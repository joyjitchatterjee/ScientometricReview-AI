AB The development of a viable structural health monitoring (SHM) technology for the operational condition monitoring of wind turbine blades is of great interest to the wind industry. In order for any SHM technology to achieve the technical readiness and performance required for an operational implementation, advanced signal processing algorithms need to be developed to adaptively remove noise and retain the underlying signals of interest that describe the damage-related information. The wavelet packet transform decomposes a measured time domain signal into a time-frequency representation enabling the removal of noise that may overlap with the signal of interest in time and/or frequency. However, the traditional technique suffers from several assumptions limiting its applicability in an operational SHM environment, where the noise conditions commonly exhibit erratic behavior. Furthermore, an exhaustive number of options exist when selecting the parameters used in the technique with limited guidelines that can help select the most appropriate options for a given application. Appropriately defining the technique tends to be a daunting task resulting in a general avoidance of the approach in the field of SHM.
   This work outlines an adaptive wavelet packet denoising algorithm applicable to numerous SHM technologies including acoustics, vibrations, and acoustic emission. The algorithm incorporates a blend of non-traditional approaches for noise estimation, threshold selection, and threshold application to augment the denoising performance of real-time structural health monitoring measurements. Appropriate wavelet packet parameters are selected through a simulation considering the trade-off between signal to noise ratio improvement and amount of signal energy retained. The wavelet parameter simulation can be easily replicated to accommodate any SHM technology where the underlying signal of interest is known, as is the case in most active-based approaches including acoustic and wave-propagation techniques. The finalized adaptive wavelet packet algorithm is applied to a comprehensive dataset demonstrating an active acoustic damage detection approach on a similar to 46 m wind turbine blade. The quality of the measured data and the damage detection performance obtained from simple spectral filtering is compared with the proposed wavelet packet technique. It is shown that the damage detection performance is enhanced in all but one test case by as much as 60%, and the false detection rate is reduced. The approach and the subsequent results presented in this paper are expected to help enable advancement in the performance of several established SHM technologies and identifies the considered acoustics-based SHM approach as a noteworthy option for wind turbine blade structural health monitoring.

AB Vibration monitoring using sensors mounted on machines is widely used for rotating machinery fault diagnosis. The periodic overlapping group sparsity (POGS) method has been developed in previous work of authors, and is an effective technique for detecting faults induced in rotating machines. However, the regularization parameter of the POGS problem is roughly specified via a look-up table provided in the original work. To address this problem, a data-driven diagnostic method, which is termed the adaptively regularized periodic overlapping group sparsity (ARPOGS), is proposed in this paper. The non-stationary fault feature ratio which is defined in the Hilbert domain is employed to guide the optimal regularization parameter. The criterion of setting the interval of candidate regularization parameters is also discussed. The ARPOGS is developed in terms of a convex optimization problem, while non-convex regularizations are used to further promote the sparsity. Since the non-convex penalty term is used and the whole objective function is constrained as a convex optimization problem, the sparsity of useful fault features is maximally induced. A simulated signal is formulated to verify the performance of the proposed method for periodic feature extraction. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed ARPOGS method is validated by analyzing real data collected from a wind turbine transmission system. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively and automatically extract periodic-group-sparse features from noisy vibration signals.

ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS
AB Aimed at the difficulty of diagnosing the transmission system of wind turbine under variable working conditions, a novel health condition monitoring method based on common features distribution adaptation is proposed in this article. In the method, envelope analysis is first performed on the collected signals, and then the time-frequency features are extracted to be combined as new input samples. The feature set under the working condition similar to target working condition is selected as the auxiliary sample set in source domain through the evaluation of the transferability. The kernel function is used to map the labeled auxiliary samples and unlabeled target samples to a reproduced kernel Hilbert space, which effectively reduces the data distribution discrepancy between source and target domains. The problem of class imbalance in each domain is taken into account when performing fault recognition, which improves the effect of transfer learning. Finally, the adjusted source domain is used to train the classifier, which is applied to the target domain to get the predicted labels of the test data. Experiment shows that the proposed method has better working performance than traditional fault diagnosis methods.

AB Planet bearing fault identification is an attractive but challenging task in wind turbine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Traditional fault characteristic frequency identification based diagnostic strategies are not sufficient for reliable planet bearing fault detection, due to complex physical configurations and modulation characteristics in planetary drivetrains. In this paper, we propose a discriminative dictionary learning based sparse representation classification (DDL-SRC) framework for intelligent planet bearing fault identification. Our framework could learn a reconstructive and discriminative dictionary for signal sparse representation and an optimal linear classifier for classification tasks simultaneously, which bridges the gap between dictionary learning and classifier training in traditional SRC methods. Specifically, the optimization objective introduces a novel regularization term called 'discriminative sparse codes error' and incorporates it with the reconstruction error and classification error. Thus, the dictionary learned by our framework possesses not only the reconstructive power for sparse representation but also the discriminative power for classifier training. The optimization formulation is efficiently solved using K-SVD and orthogonal matching pursuit algorithms. The experiment validations have been conducted for demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed DDL-SRC framework over the state-of-the-art dictionary learning based SRC and deep convolutional neural network methods for intelligent planet bearing fault identification.

AB Condition monitoring (CM) has been playing an important role in the operation and maintenance of industrial equipment. However, the changeable environments where some equipment, such as wind turbines (WTs) are installed, have put a negative effect on CM. To deal with this problem, this article proposes a CM method of WTs based on assembled multidimensional membership functions (MFs) using a fuzzy inference system. First, multidimensional MFs, which are formed by fusing environment factor into conventional MFs, are proposed to reduce the negative effect from changeable environments. Second, the input data are properly divided into segments and the segments are classified into four types to distinguish the effects of different data on CM. Different weights are assigned to each segment and the corresponding membership of each segment is calculated separately. Then, these memberships are assembled for fuzzy inference. Finally, based on the assembled multidimensional MFs, a new CM architecture is established. Four groups of experiments were carried out to evaluate the proposed method with the data collected from a wind farm in northern China. The experiments results show that the proposed method can not only detect anomalies at an early stage but also effectively decrease the false alarms and missing detections.

AB Wind power plays a key role in reducing global carbon emission. The power curve provided by wind turbine manufacturers offers an effective way of presenting the global performance of wind turbines. However, due to the complicated dynamics nature of offshore wind turbines, and the harsh environment in which they are operating, wind power forecasting is challenging, but at the same time vital to enable condition monitoring (CM). Wind turbine power prediction, using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data, may not lead to the optimum control strategy as sensors may generate non-calibrated data due to degradation. To mitigate the adverse effects of outliers from SCADA data on wind power forecasting, this paper proposed a novel approach to perform power prediction using high-frequency SCADA data, based on isolate forest (IF) and deep learning neural networks. In the predictive model, wind speed, nacelle orientation, yaw error, blade pitch angle, and ambient temperature were considered as input features, while wind power is evaluated as the output feature. The deep learning model has been trained, tested, and validated against SCADA measurements. Compared against the conventional predictive model used for outlier detection, i.e. based on Gaussian Process (GP), the proposed integrated approach, which coupled IF and deep learning, is expected to be a more efficient tool for anomaly detection in wind power prediction.

AB Autonomous fault detection plays a major role in the Critical Energy Infrastructure (CEI) domain, since sensor faults cause irreparable damage and lead to incorrect results on the condition monitoring of Cyber-Physical (CP) systems. This paper focuses on the challenging application of wind turbine (WT) monitoring. Specifically, we propose the two challenging architectures based on learning deep features, namely-Long Short Term Memory-Stacked Autoencoders (LSTM-SAE), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN-SAE), for semi-supervised fault detection in wind CPs. The internal learnt features will facilitate the classification task by assigning each upcoming measurement into its corresponding faulty/normal operation status. To illustrate the quality of our schemes, their performance is evaluated against real-world's wind turbine data. From the experimental section we are able to validate that both LSTM-SAE and CNN-SAE schemes provide high classification scores, indicating the high detection rate of the fault level of the wind turbines. Additionally, slight modification on our architectures are able to be applied on different fault/anomaly detection categories on variant Cyber-Physical systems.

AB The maintenance of wind turbines is of growing importance considering the transition to renewable energy. This paper presents a multi-robot-approach for automated wind turbine maintenance including a novel climbing robot. Currently, wind turbine maintenance remains a manual task, which is monotonous, dangerous, and also physically demanding due to the large scale of wind turbines. Technical climbers are required to work at significant heights, even in bad weather conditions. Furthermore, a skilled labor force with sufficient knowledge in repairing fiber composite material is rare. Autonomous mobile systems enable the digitization of the maintenance process. They can be designed for weather-independent operations. This work contributes to the development and experimental validation of a maintenance system consisting of multiple robotic platforms for a variety of tasks, such as wind turbine tower and rotor blade service. In this work, multicopters with vision and LiDAR sensors for global inspection are used to guide slower climbing robots. Light-weight magnetic climbers with surface contact were used to analyze structure parts with non-destructive inspection methods and to locally repair smaller defects. Localization was enabled by adapting odometry for conical-shaped surfaces considering additional navigation sensors. Magnets were suitable for steel towers to clamp onto the surface. A friction-based climbing ring robot (SMART- Scanning, Monitoring, Analyzing, Repair and Transportation) completed the set-up for higher payload. The maintenance period could be extended by using weather-proofed maintenance robots. The multi-robot-system was running the Robot Operating System (ROS). Additionally, first steps towards machine learning would enable maintenance staff to use pattern classification for fault diagnosis in order to operate safely from the ground in the future.

AB In this paper the application of cyclostationary signal processing in conjunction with Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) technique, on the fault diagnostics of wind turbine gearboxes is investigated and has been highlighted. It is shown that the EEMD technique together with cyclostationary analysis can be used to detect the damage in complex and non-linear systems such as wind turbine gearbox, where the vibration signals are modulated with carrier frequencies and are superimposed. In these situations when multiple faults alongside noisy environment are present together, the faults are not easily detectable by conventional signal processing techniques such as FFT and RMS.

AB Neutron diffraction is an established method for non-destructively characterising residual stress or observing in situ strain during external stimuli. Neutron based stroboscopic techniques have previously been introduced for measuring strains undergoing cyclic processes but have not been used for tribological applications. This work presents a novel approach for measuring the evolution of radial strain in a rotating bearing through part of the component's lifetime. A cylindrical roller bearing was pre-overloaded to increase the probability of damage within a reasonable experimental time and to help develop further understanding of the influence such events have on bearing life, notably for the application of wind turbine gearbox bearing failure. The stroboscopic neutron diffraction technique was successful in measuring time-resolved contact strain, with a significant increase in compressive radial strain being observed after a suspected failure had been detected using condition monitoring techniques, implemented for validating damage propagation. Cyclic contact strains associated with rolling contact fatigue were also evaluated using neutron diffraction. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Due to severe working condition, unexpected failures in wind turbine gearbox become rather frequent and may lead to long downtime or even catastrophic casualties. However, traditional diagnosis techniques based on vibration, acoustic emission etc. still face some problems when they are used for failure identification of wind turbine gearbox. Encoder signal carries rich diagnostic information which may be considered as an alternative tool for the wind turbine condition monitoring. Motivated by this, the encoder signal is initially introduced for the fault diagnosis of wind turbine gear in this paper. A novel adaptive filtering method, improved maximum correlated kurtosis deconvolution adjusted (IMCKDA), is proposed to eliminate the diverse noises in encoder signal. Additionally, to overcome the limitation from the sensibility of discontinuity point and filtered signal in traditional deconvolution methods (DMs), convolution adjustment definition is introduced. And correlated Gini index (CG) is originally designed to guide the selection of filter length. Finally, the encoder signal is verified to be an alternative tool for the fault diagnosis of wind turbine gear by real experimental cases. And without any prior knowledge and the least input parameters, IMCKDA is more suitable for processing encoder signal than existing state-ofthe-art DMs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the complicated operating environment and variable operating conditions, wind turbines (WTs) are extremely prone to failure and the frequency of fault increases year by year. Therefore, the solutions of effective condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are urgently demanded. Since the vibration signals contain a lot of health condition information, the fault diagnosis based on vibration signals has received extensive attention and achieved impressive progress. However, in practice, the collected health condition signals are very similar and contain a lot of noise, which makes the fault diagnosis of WTs more challenging. In order to handle this problem, this paper proposes a model called denoising stacked feature enhanced autoencoder with dynamic feature enhanced factor (DSFEAE-DF). Firstly, a feature enhanced autoencoder (FEAE) is constructed through feature enhancement so that the discriminative features can be extracted. Secondly, a feature enhanced factor which is independent of manual judgments is proposed and embedded into the training process. Finally, the DSFEAE-DF, combining one noise adding scheme, stacked FEAEs and dynamic feature enhanced factor, is established. Through experimental comparisons, the superiorities of the proposed DSFEAE-DF are verified.

AB This paper presents a simplified automated fault detection scheme for wind turbine induction generators with rotor electrical asymmetries. Fault indicators developed in previous works have made use of the presence of significant spectral peaks in the upper sidebands of the supply frequency harmonics; however, the specific location of these peaks may shift depending on the wind turbine speed. As wind turbines tend to operate under variable speed conditions, it may be difficult to predict where these fault-related peaks will occur. To accommodate for variable speeds and resulting shifting frequency peak locations, previous works have introduced methods to identify or track the relevant frequencies, which necessitates an additional set of processing algorithms to locate these fault-related peaks prior to any fault analysis. In this work, a simplified method is proposed to instead bypass the issue of variable speed (and shifting frequency peaks) by introducing a set of bandpass filters that encompass the ranges in which the peaks are expected to occur. These filters are designed to capture the fault-related spectral information to train a classifier for automatic fault detection, regardless of the specific location of the peaks. Initial experimental results show that this approach is robust against variable speeds and further shows good generalizability in being able to detect faults at speeds and conditions that were not presented during training. After training and tuning the proposed fault detection system, the system was tested on "unseen" data and yielded a high classification accuracy of 97.4%, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach.

AB Rotor-roller bearing-housing systems (RBHSs) are widely utilized in many industrial machinery, such as aero-engines, high speed trains, wind turbine, etc. A clearly investigation of vibrations for the RBHSs is very valuable for condition monitoring and fault detection applications for the above industrial machines. A new analytical dynamic model for a RBHS is conducted, which can consider the time dependent additional contact zone excitation caused by the fault on the raceways, deformable interface between the outer raceway and housing, lubricating oil film, and deformable rotor and housing. The time dependent addition contact zone is determined by Hertzian contact theory and the relative relationship between the roller and fault. Influences of the rotor speed, roller load and fault length on the additional excitation zone are studied. The ratio of the additional excitation zone to the fault length is also discussed. To consider the complex profiles of the outer raceway, an analytical method combined with a slice method and an integral method is used to obtain the total interface stiffness at the interface. Influences of the housing materials and height on the total interface stiffness are analyzed. A time dependent displacement excitation model with a half-sine function profile is applied to formulate the time dependent displacement excitation due to the fault. The dynamics of the RBHS from the presented model with the additional excitation zone are compared with those from the previous model without the additional excitation zone. An experimental study is presented to validate the proposed model. Influences of the housing materials, housing height, additional excitation zone of the fault, and fault length on the dynamics of the RBHS are studied. The simulation results provide that the presented model can give an accurate simulation method for investigating the dynamics of the RBHS with a localized fault. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Since variational mode decomposition (VMD) was proposed, it has been widely used in condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of mechanical equipment. However, the parameters K and alpha in the VMD algorithm need to be set before decomposition, which causes VMD to be unable to decompose adaptively and obtain the best result for signal decomposition. Therefore, this paper optimizes the VMD algorithm. On this basis, this paper also proposes a method of multi-domain feature extraction of signals and combines an extreme learning machine (ELM) to realize comprehensive and accurate fault diagnosis. First, VMD is optimized according to the improved grey wolf optimizer; second, the feature vectors of the time, frequency, and time-frequency domains are calculated, which are synthesized after dimensionality reduction; ultimately, the synthesized vectors are input into the ELM for training and classification. The experimental results show that the proposed method can decompose the signal adaptively, which produces the best decomposition parameters and results. Moreover, this method can extract the fault features of the signal more completely to realize accurate fault identification.

AB Today, condition monitoring (CM) is unarguably the most important field in any industrial applications. CM of wind turbines (WT's) has in the past few years grown substantially. Although numerous initiatives to develop CM techniques and make operations more efficient were launched, most developed tools failed to respond on time to unpredictable events. One area that shows great potential in the battle against machine damages and their exploits is the diagnosis and prognosis of WT gears. In the world of big varying modulated data, analysis of health conditions of WT gears by traditional CM methods is no longer sufficient. Example for this is the high dimensionality and very extremely modulated vibration dataset, provided by Suzlon company. Suzlon unworkably attempted to online discriminate its machines using a set of well-known CM analysis methods. However, only visual inspection could identify the faulty WT gear. Hence, Suzlon flagged up a top priority need to identify more efficient online tools for improving CM processes. In the response to this essential need, the author employs Signal Intensity Estimator (SIE) method and some machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyse Suzlon dataset. A conclusion was reached that these techniques could successfully provide a reliable estimate of WT's conditions. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Health condition monitoring through comprehensive monitoring, incipient fault diagnosis, and the prediction of impending faults allows for the promotion of the long-term performance of wind turbines, particularly those in harsh environments such as cold regions. The condition monitoring of wind turbines is characterized by the difficulties associated with the lack of measured data and the nonstationary, stochastic, and complicated nature of vibration responses. This article presents a characterization of the vibrations of an operational wind turbine by spectrogram, scalogram, and bi-spectrum analyses. The results reveal varied nonstationary stochastic properties and mode-coupling instability in the vibrations of the tested wind turbine tower. The analysis illustrates that the wind turbine system vibrations exhibit certain non-Gaussian stochastic properties. An analytical model is used to evaluate the nonstationary, stochastic phenomena and mode-coupling phenomena observed in the experimental results. These results are of significance for the fault diagnosis of wind turbine system in operation as well as for improving fatigue designs beyond the wind turbulence spectral models recommended in the standards.

ID PLANETARY GEARBOX; PREDICTION; FAILURE; TIME
AB Condition monitoring of gear-based mechanical systems in non-stationary operation conditions is in general very challenging. This issue is particularly important for wind energy technology because most of the modern wind turbines are geared and gearbox damages account for at least the 20% of their unavailability time. In this work, a new method for the diagnosis of drive -train bearings damages is proposed: the general idea is that vibrations are measured at the tower instead of at the gearbox. This implies that measurements can be performed without impacting the wind turbine operation. The test case considered in this work is a wind farm owned by the Renvico company, featuring six wind turbines with 2 MW of rated power each. A measurement campaign has been conducted in winter 2019 and vibration measurements have been acquired at five wind turbines in the farm. The rationale for this choice is that, when the measurements have been acquired, three wind turbines were healthy, one wind turbine had recently recovered from a planetary bearing fault, and one wind turbine was undergoing a high speed shaft bearing fault. The healthy wind turbines are selected as references and the damaged and recovered are selected as targets: vibration measurements are processed through a multivariate Novelty Detection algorithm in the feature space, with the objective of distinguishing the target wind turbines with respect to the reference ones. The application of this algorithm is justified by univariate statistical tests on the selected time -domain features and by a visual inspection of the data set via Principal Component Analysis. Finally, a novelty index based on the Mahalanobis distance is used to detect the anomalous conditions at the damaged wind turbine. The main result of the study is that the statistical novelty of the damaged wind turbine data set arises clearly, and this supports that the proposed measurement and processing methods are promising for wind turbine condition monitoring.

ID ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; DIAGNOSTICS
AB Digitally enhanced services for wind power could reduce operations and maintenance costs as well as the levelized cost of energy. Therefore, there is a continuous need for advanced monitoring techniques, which can exploit the opportunities of internet of things and big data analytics, revolutionizing the future of the energy sector. The heart of wind turbines is a rather complex epicyclic gearbox. Among others, extremely critical gearbox components, which are often responsible for machinery stops, are the rolling element bearings. The vibration signatures of bearings are rather weak compared to other components, such as gears, and as a result, an extended number of signal processing techniques and tools have been proposed during the last decades, focusing toward accurate, early, and on time bearing fault detection with limited false alarms and missed detections. Envelope analysis is one of the most important methodologies, where an envelope of the vibration signal is estimated usually after filtering around a frequency band excited by impacts due to the bearing faults. Different tools, such as Kurtogram, have been proposed in order to accurately select the optimum filter parameters (center frequency and bandwidth). Cyclic spectral correlation (CSC) and cyclic spectral coherence (CSCoh), based on cyclostationary analysis, have been proved as very powerful tools for condition monitoring. The monitoring techniques seem to have reached a mature level in case a machinery operates under steady speed and load. On the other hand, in case the operating conditions change, it is still unclear whether the change of the monitoring indicators is due to the change of the health of the machinery or due to the change of the operating parameters. Recently, the authors have proposed a new tool called improved envelope spectrum via feature optimization-gram (IESFOgram), which is based on CSCoh and can automatically select the filtering band. Furthermore, the CSCoh is integrated along the selected frequency band leading to an improved envelope spectrum (IES). In this paper, the performance of the tool is evaluated and further extended on cases operating under different speeds and different loads. The effectiveness of the methodology is tested and validated on the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) wind turbine gearbox vibration condition monitoring benchmarking dataset, which includes various faults with different levels of diagnostic complexity as well as various speed and load operating conditions.

AB Bearings are the culprit of a large quantity of Wind Turbine (WT) gearbox failures and account for a high percentage of the total of global WT downtime. Damage within rolling element bearings have been shown to initiate beneath the surface which defies detection by conventional vibration monitoring as the geometry of the rolling surface is unaltered. However, once bearing damage reaches the surface, it generates spalling and quickly drives the deterioration of the entire gearbox through the introduction of debris into the oil system. There is a pressing need for performing damage detection before damage reaches the bearing surface. This paper presents a methodology for detecting sub-surface damage using Acoustic Emission (AE) measurements. AE measurements are well known for their sensitivity to incipient damage. However, the background noise and operational variations within a bearing necessitate the use of a principled statistical procedure for damage detection. This is addressed here through the use of probabilistic modelling, more specifically Gaussian mixture models. The methodology is validated using a full-scale rig of a WT bearing. The bearings are seeded with sub-surface and early-stage surface defects in order to provide a comparison of the detectability at each level of a fault progression.

AB Operation and maintenance costs of wind power plants represent a significant share of the total expenditure of a wind farm project. It is therefore vital to optimize maintenance activities in order to reduce costs while improving wind turbine reliability and availability. The induction generator is a major contributor to failure rates and downtime of wind turbines, where doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) are the dominant variable-speed technology employed. Actual data from operating wind turbines is seldom presented in the scientific literature. This paper analyzes two in-service DFIGs from wind turbines operating in a Spanish wind power plant. One of the generators under study reported excessive temperature on the rotor windings, while the other did not. In order to achieve a diagnosis for the reported excess of temperature, current signature analyses were performed on both machines. Fault-related frequency components were identified in the current spectra of the faulty machine, and were compared against the healthy one. A diagnosis was achieved for the faulty machine: Dynamic eccentricity caused by a rotor fault was identified as the cause of the excessive temperature in the rotor windings.

AB The presence of incorrect data leads to the decrease of condition-monitoring big data quality. As a result, unreliable or misleading results are probably obtained by analyzing these poor-quality data. In this paper, to improve the data quality, an incorrect data detection method based on an improved local outlier factor (LOF) is proposed for data cleaning. First, a sliding window technique is used to divide data into different segments. These segments are considered as different objects and their attributes consist of time-domain statistical features extracted from each segment, such as mean, maximum and peak-to-peak value. Second, a kernel-based LOF (KLOF) is calculated using these attributes to evaluate the degree of each segment being incorrect data. Third, according to these KLOF values and a threshold value, incorrect data are detected. Finally, a simulation of vibration data generated by a defective rolling element bearing and three real cases concerning a fixed-axle gearbox, a wind turbine, and a planetary gearbox are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to detect both missing segments and abnormal segments, which are two typical incorrect data, effectively, and thus is helpful for big data cleaning of machinery condition monitoring.

TI Bearing monitoring in the wind turbine drivetrain: A comparative study

AB Wind turbines are often plagued by premature component failures, with drivetrain bearings being particularly subjected to these failures. To identify failing components, vibration condition monitoring has emerged and grown substantially. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is the major signal processing method of vibrations. Recently, the wavelet transforms have been used more frequently in bearing vibration research, with one alternative being the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Here, the low-frequency component of the signal is repeatedly decomposed into approximative and detailed coefficients using a predefined mother wavelet. An extension to this is the wavelet packet transform (WPT), which decomposes the entire frequency domain and stores the wavelet coefficients in packets. How wavelet transforms and FFT compare regarding fault detection in wind turbine drivetrain bearings has been largely overlooked in literature when applied on field data, with non-ideal placement of sensors and uncertain parameters influencing the measurements. This study consists of a comprehensive comparison of the FFT, a three-level DWT, and the WPT when applied on enveloped vibration measurements from two 2.5-MW wind turbine gearbox bearing failures. The frequency content is compared by calculating a robust condition indicator by summation of the harmonics and shaft speed sidebands of the bearing fault frequencies. Results show a higher performance of the WPT when used as a field vibration measurement analysis tool compared with the FFT as it detects one bearing failure earlier and more clearly, leading to a more stable alarm setting and avoidable, costly false alarms.

AB Wind energy is an important source of renewable energy with significant untapped potential around the world. However, the cost of wind energy production is high, and efforts to lower the cost of energy generation will help enable more widespread use of wind energy. Yaw error reduces the efficiency of turbines as well as lowers the reliability of key components in turbines. Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) devices can correct the yaw error; however, they are expensive, and there is a trade-off between their costs and benefits. In this study, a stochastic discrete-event simulation was developed that models the operation of a wind farm. We maximize the net present value (NPV) changes associated with using LIDAR devices in a wind farm and determine the optimum number of LIDAR devices and their associated turbine stay time as a function of number of turbines in the wind farm for specific turbine sizes. The outcome of this work will help wind farm owners and operators make informed decisions about purchasing LIDAR devices for their wind farms.

AB This paper introduces a new condition monitoring approach for extracting fault signatures in wind turbine blades by utilizing the data from a real-time Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. A hybrid fault detection system based on a combination of Generalized Regression Neural Network Ensemble for Single Imputation (GRNN-ESI) algorithm, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and wavelet-based Probability Density Function (PDF) approach is proposed in this work. The proposed fault detection strategy accurately detects incipient blade failures and leads to improved maintenance cost and availability of the system. Experimental test results based on data from a wind farm in southwestern Ontario, Canada, illustrate the effectiveness and high accuracy of the proposed monitoring approach.

AB Doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) are negatively affected by inter-turn short-circuit faults (ITSCFs) of rotor windings, and considering the safety and continuous operation of the wind turbine surveillance of DFIGs is of immense importance. For this purpose, an experimental platform was designed to detect ITSCFs in rotor windings. An experimental set-up with a 100 kW three-phase wound rotor induction machine and a condition monitoring system was constructed to obtain real-time experimental data. Different tapping points were set up to induce different ITSCFs. The rotor current was used for the analysis of the ITSCFs. First, spectral analysis was performed, and the ensuing results suggest that some harmonic frequency components were generated during the ITSCFs in addition to the fundamental frequency component. Additionally, the RMS value of the rotor current was measured during the process. In the next step, a wavelet coefficient of detail level 9 was found to be effective in analysing such harmonic frequency components in the rotor current. In the end, a new method based on the RMS value of the wavelet coefficient and the RMS value of the rotor current was proposed that can calculate the fault severity. It is concluded that such signal processing techniques are appropriate to detect ITSCFs and determine the fault severity in rotor windings in DFIGs.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Aimed at identifying the health state of wind turbines accurately by comprehensively using the change information in spatial and temporal scale of the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data, a novel condition monitoring method of wind turbines based on spatio-temporal features fusion of SCADA data by convolutional neural networks (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) was proposed in this paper. First, missing value complement and selection of variables with Pearson prod-moment correlation coefficient were applied to improve the effectiveness of SCADA data. Second, a deep learning model was constructed by the structures of CNN and GRU. The spatial features in SCADA data were extracted by CNN at every step, and the temporal features in the sequence of spatial features were extracted and fused by GRU. Third, the historical healthy SCADA data was used to train the normal behavior model. At last, the trained model received measured data and output the predicted values. The entire residual between the actual data and the predicted output was calculated to put into the exponential weighted moving average control chart for recognizing the condition of the wind turbine. The effectiveness and availability of the proposed method were proved in measured SCADA data experiments. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate and efficient condition monitoring is the key to enhance the reliability and security of wind turbines. In recent years, an intelligent anomaly detection method based on deep learning networks has been receiving increasing attention. Since accurately labeled data are usually difficult to obtain in real industries, this paper proposes a novel Deep Small-World Neural Network (DSWNN) on the basis of unsupervised learning to detect the early failures of wind turbines. During network construction, a regular auto-encoder network with multiple restricted Boltzmann machines is first constructed and pre-trained by using unlabeled data of wind turbines. After that, the trained network is transformed into a DSWNN model by randomly add-edges method, where the network parameters are fine-tuned by using minimal amounts of labeled data. In order to guard against the changes and disturbances of wind speed and reduce false alarms, an adaptive threshold based on extreme value theory is presented as the criterion of anomaly judgment. The DSWNN model is excellent in depth mining data characteristics and accurate measurement error. Last, two failure cases of wind turbine anomaly detection are given to demonstrate its validity and accuracy of the proposed methodology contrasted with the deep belief network and deep neural network.

AB Given the prejudicial environmental effects of fossil-fuel based energy production, renewable energy sources can contribute significantly to the sustainability of human society. As a clean, cost effective and inexhaustible renewable energy source, wind energy harvesting has found a wide application to replace conventional energy productions. However, concerns have been raised over the noise generated by turbine operating, which is helpful in fault diagnose but primarily identified for its adverse effects on the local ecosystems. Therefore, noise monitoring and separation is essential in wind turbine deployment. Recent developments in condition monitoring provide a solution for turbine noise and vibration analysis. However, the major component, aerodynamic noise is often distorted in modulation, which consequently affects the condition monitoring. This study is conducted to explore a novel approach to extract low-frequency elements from the aerodynamic noise background, and to improve the efficiency of online monitoring. A framework built on the spline envelope method and improved local mean decomposition has been developed for low-frequency noise extraction, and a case study with real near-field noises generated by a mountain-located wind turbine was employed to validate the proposed approach. Results indicate successful extractions with high resolution and efficiency. Findings of this research are also expected to further support the fault diagnosis and the improvement in condition monitoring of turbine systems.

AB The main objective of the proposed research study is to discriminate different blade fault conditions which affect the wind turbine blades under operating condition through machine learning approach. A three bladed wind turbine was chosen and the faults like blade bend, blade cracks, blade erosion, hub-blade loose connection and pitch angle twist were considered in the study. This problem is formulated as a machine learning problem which consists of three phases, namely feature extraction, feature selection and feature classification. Histogram features were extracted from vibration signals and feature selection was carried out using J48 decision tree algorithm. Feature classification was performed using lazy classifiers like nearest neighbour, k-nearest neighbours, locally weighted learning and K-star classifier. The results of these classifiers were compared with respect to their correctly classified instances (accuracy percentage) and found that, locally weighted learning yielded a maximum accuracy of 93.83% with a computational time of 0.07 s.

AB In-service turbine monitoring is essential for maximizing the wind energy contribution to the global energy budget. Measurement of turbine shaft torque under transient wind conditions is fundamental to develop reliable condition monitoring techniques. Contact based measurements bring their own disadvantages and non-contactless measurements have many potential advantages. However, their performance needs to be validated against standard methods. This paper focuses on the development of an enhanced transient Feature Selective Validation (FSV) techniques to undertake this analysis with an emphasis on transient data processing. The nature of FSV makes it a natural technique to consider for this problem space. Open questions have existed as to how transients should be dealt with in FSV. This paper overcomes the limitations of previous approaches for step-function transient comparison and presents analytical methods to ensure the transient feature itself is considered, irrespective of how much pre-and post- transient data happens to be included.

ID MODEL
AB With development of grid-connected wind power, data-driven wind turbine power curve (WTPC) becomes vital for many valuable applications whereas it is hugely affected by the potential outliers in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. In this paper, high-fidelity WTPC modeling and its application on condition monitoring are deeply studied. Firstly, through irregular space-division and nonlinear space-mapping, stepwise data cleaning procedure is proposed. On this basis, the cleaned data are used for high-fidelity modeling where optimized least square support vector machine (LSSVM) is chosen for deterministic WTPC modeling and conditional kernel density estimation (CKDE) is selected for uncertainty modeling after comparison where the models are updated via the sliding time window mechanism. Using the consistency of historical data-driven models in a certain future time window, a daily condition monitoring system, including daily multi-index system and improved fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method (FCEM), is established to monitor future wind turbine condition. Finally, measured data from a wind farm in north China are acquired for validation. The results show that the outliers are effectively cleaned for high-fidelity WTPC modeling. The daily condition monitoring system including daily raw data preprocessing, multi-index system and FCEM algorithm can provide efficient daily rating score. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Condition monitoring is usually performed over long periods of time when critical rotating machines such as wind turbine gearboxes are monitored. There are many potential signal processing and analysis techniques that can be utilised to diagnose the machine from the condition monitoring data, however, they seldom incorporate the available healthy historical data of a machine systematically in the fault diagnosis process. Hence, a methodology is proposed in this article which supplements the order-frequency spectral coherence with historical data from a healthy machine to perform automatic fault detection, automatic fault localisation and fault trending. This has the benefit that the order-frequency spectral coherence, a very powerful technique for rotating machine fault diagnosis under varying speed conditions, can be utilised without requiring an expert to interpret the results. In this methodology, an extended version of the improved envelope spectrum is utilised to extract features from the order-frequency spectral coherence, whereafter a probabilistic model is carefully used to calculate a diagnostic metric for automatic fault detection and localisation. The methodology is investigated on numerical gearbox data as well as experimental gearbox data, both acquired under time-varying operating conditions with two probabilistic models, namely a Gaussian model and a kernel density estimator, compared as well. The results indicate the potential of this methodology for performing gearbox fault diagnosis under varying operating conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Among the various maintenance technologies of wind turbines, online fault prediction technology is a kind of more cost-effective and reliable method. It may also be the most promising method for wind turbines with potential mechanical faults. SCADA data-based online condition monitoring technology has become a hot spot in current researches. Therefore, a novel fault prediction method based on the Pair-Copula model is proposed in this study. First, the conditional mutual information method is introduced to screen out useful variables from a number of variables. Then aiming at the limitation that the conventional Copula model can only deal with two-dimensional variables, the Pair-Copula model is introduced. In addition, the complexity of the prediction model and the dimension of the input variables are greatly reduced by the Pair-Copula model. So, the BP neural network is selected to complete the prediction model. A combined model based on BP neural network and Pair-Copula model is proposed. In order to solve the problem that the conventional Pair-Copula model cannot process real-time data which must be required in fault prediction, a kind of improved Pair-Copula model combined with the kernel density estimation is used to calculate the real-time data. Finally, the proposed method is validated with real data from a 1.5 MW wind turbine, and the effectiveness is confirmed.

AB The current pace of renewable energy development around the world is unprecedented, with offshore wind in particular proving to be an extremely valuable and reliable energy source. The global installed capacity of offshore wind turbines by the end of 2022 is expected to reach the 46.4 GW, among which 33.9 GW in Europe. Costs are critical for the future success of the offshore wind sector. The industry is pushing hard to make cost reductions to show that offshore wind is economically comparable to conventional fossil fuels. Efficiencies in Operations and Maintenance (O&M) offer potential to achieve significant cost savings as it accounts for around 20% - 30% of overall offshore wind farm costs. One of the most critical and rather complex assembly of onshore, offshore and floating wind turbines is the gearbox. Gearboxes are designed to last till the end of the lifetime of the asset, according to the IEC 61400-4 standards. On the other hand, a recent study over approximately 350 offshore wind turbines indicate that gearboxes might have to be replaced as early as 6.5 years. Therefore sensing and condition monitoring systems for onshore, offshore and floating wind turbines are needed in order to obtain reliable information on the state and condition of different critical parts, focusing towards the detection and/or prediction of damage before it reaches a critical stage. The development and use of such technologies will allow companies to schedule actions at the right time, and thus will help reducing the costs of operation and maintenance, resulting in an increase of wind energy at a competitive price and thus strengthening productivity of the wind energy sector. At the academic level a plethora of methodologies have been proposed during the last decades for the analysis of vibration signatures focusing towards early and accurate fault detection with limited-false alarms and missed detections. Among others, Envelope Analysis is one of the most important methodologies, where an envelope of the vibration signal is estimated, usually after filtering around a selected frequency band excited by impacts due to the faults. Different tools, such as Kurtogram, have been proposed in order to accurately select the optimum filter parameters (center frequency and bandwidth). Cyclostationary Analysis and corresponding methodologies, i.e. the Cyclic Spectral Correlation and the Cyclic Spectral Coherence, have been proved as powerful tools for condition monitoring. On the other hand the application, test and evaluation of such tools on general industrial cases is still rather limited. Therefore the main aim of this paper is the application and evaluation of advanced diagnostic techniques and diagnostic indicators, including the Enhanced Envelope Spectrum and the Spectral Flatness on real world vibration data collected from vibration sensors on gearboxes in multiple wind turbines over an extended period of time of nearly four years. The diagnostic indicators are compared with classical statistic time and frequency indicators, i.e. Kurtosis, Crest Factor etc. and their effectiveness is evaluated based on the successful detection of two failure events.

ID FAULT-DETECTION; DIAGNOSIS
AB Drivetrain bearings are seen as the most common reason of the wind turbine drivetrain system failures and the consequent downtimes. In this study, the angular velocity error function is used for the condition monitoring of the bearings and gears in the wind turbine drivetrain. This approach benefits from using the sensor data and the dedicated communication network which already exist in the turbine for performance monitoring purposes. Minor required modification includes an additional moderate sampling frequency encoder without any need of adding an extra condition monitoring system. The additional encoder is placed on the low speed shaft and can also be used as the backup for the high speed shaft encoder which is critical for turbine control purposes. A theory based on the variations of the energy of response around the defect frequency is suggested to detect abnormalities in the drivetrain operation. The proposed angular velocity based method is compared with the classical vibration-based detection approach based on axial/radial acceleration data, for the faults initiated by different types of excitation sources. The method is experimentally evaluated using the data obtained from the encoders and vibration sensors of an operational wind turbine.

AB Details about a fault's progression, including the remaining-useful-lifetime (RUL), are key features in monitoring, industrial operation and maintenance (O&M) planning. In order to avoid increases in O&M costs through subjective human involvement and over-conservative control strategies, this work presents models to estimate the RUL for wind turbine main bearing failures. The prediction of the RUL is estimated from a likelihood function based on concepts from prognostics and health management, and survival analysis. The RUL is estimated by training the model on run-to-failure wind turbines, extracting a parametrization of a probability density function. In order to ensure analytical moments, a Weibull distribution is assumed. Alongside the RUL model, the fault's progression is abstracted as discrete states following the bearing stages from damage detection, through overtemperature warnings, to over overtemperature alarms and failure, and are integrated in a separate assessment model. Assuming a naive O&M plan (wind turbines are run as close to failure as possible without regards for infrastructure or supply chain constrains), 67 non run-to-failure wind turbines are assessed with respect to their early stopping, revealing the potential RUL lost. These are turbines that have been stopped by the operator prior to their failure. On average it was found that wind turbines are stopped 13 days prior to their failure, accumulating 786 days of potentially lost operations across the 67 wind turbines.

ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS
AB As one of the most promising renewable energy resources, a large amount of wind energy has been implemented all around the world since 1990s. Increasing the size of the wind turbines and the harsh operating environment lead to the higher failure rates on the wind turbines compared with the other renewable resources. As a result, not only unplanned maintenance and repairments increases but also the downtime of the wind turbine increases the operational cost significantly. In addition, the long-distance transmission lines are required to transfer the wind generation power to the load centers due to the remote operation location of the wind farms. To improve the power transfer capability, the series-compensated lines are adopted in many cases. However, subsynchronous control interactions (SSCI) could happen between the series-compensated transmission lines and the wind turbines. This may damage the wind turbine components severely and cause stability issues in the power grids. Currently, various condition monitoring systems have been developed and applied for the wind turbines. Different SSCI detection mechanisms are also proposed in many studies. This article proposes a field-programmable gate array CPU-based holistic monitoring system which not only provides both condition and SSCI monitoring functions simultaneously in real time but also records the necessary data for the postevent analysis.

AB As wind energy assumes greater importance in remote and offshore locations, an effective and reliable condition monitoring system (CMS) has become necessary for wind turbines (WTs). Conventional CMSs used in the power generation industry have been applied to WTs commercially. However, the operating environment of a WT is much different from that of a power plant. Moreover, current CMSs require the deployment of various sensors and computationally intensive analysis techniques. An empirical and low-cost CMS against shaft imbalance faults and generator circuit faults is proposed in this work. The diagnostic process of the CMS is merely based on generator outputs. Since the air gap between the rotor and the stator of a generator is limited by rigid bearings, diagnosis rules for shaft imbalance faults are formulated on the basis of experimental results with the aid of a specially designed WT simulation platform. Once a test at a specified speed has been performed, the error limits of the diagnosis for generator outputs can be determined. The proposed fault recognition procedure is practical and easy to conduct. The efficacy of the proposed CMS against four types of fault, namely, low-speed shaft imbalance, high-speed shaft imbalance, and short circuit and open circuit of a generator, has been validated practically on the WT simulation platform.

AB The wind turbine power curve is an important indicator of the performance of a wind turbine. Modeling and monitoring the power curve can detect wind turbine operation abnormalities and degradation in a timely manner. First, this paper points out the drawbacks of the standard binned power curve modeling method of IEC-61400-12-1. Multiple factors that influence wind energy capture and power output of a wind turbine are analyzed in detail and used as the power curve model inputs. A multivariable power curve model is constructed with a modified Cholesky decomposition Gaussian process (GP) and validated using wind turbine Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data. A sequential probability ratio test with two groups of hypotheses is introduced to analyze and detect abnormal changes in GP power curve prediction residuals and thus detect abnormal operation. In order to locate failed components when an alarm is identified, longitudinal and transverse data comparisons are proposed to check the operation of specific components. The modeling and monitoring methods proposed in this paper successfully identify faults and locate the faulty component for two wind turbines with anemometer failure and pitch system failure, respectively.

AB Improved seismic noise characterization, due to varied sources, may benefit traditional applications. Some examples are earthquake detection, Earth structure research, and nuclear testing. This improvement could also permit use of seismic data in transdisciplinary research such as wind gust detection and wind turbine (WT) condition monitoring. However, it is a challenging task to unambiguously quantify relationships between potential sources of seismic noise and the actual seismic response. In this article, we analyze seismic and meteorological data (wind speed and pressure), measured at a remote site in a complex terrain area in eastern Portugal, to examine seismic signatures from WT operational status and wind gusts. Results presented herein show the following: (1) WT signatures in seismic data can be used to accurately determine WT-operational status. Attenuation of WT signatures in seismic data exhibits an exponential decay with distance, with attenuation coefficients that scale with frequency. (2) After WT signatures are removed from seismic power spectra, wind gust signatures remain. Analyses of these data further indicate that it may be possible to extract quantitative wind gust estimates from seismic data and decompose them into pressure and shear stress drivers of this coupling.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Against the background of increasing cost pressure, condition monitoring is becoming increasingly relevant to the wind energy industry. The present study examines the role of wind turbulence and the non-constant variance of residuals in power curve monitoring. Power curve monitoring methods are classified and compared by means of Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that adjusting for the non-constant variance of residuals using standardisation may considerably improve the performance of control charts, no matter what method is used to generate them. Additionally, turbulence is found to be an important factor, and including it may further increase the performance of control charts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Condition monitoring (CM) of wind turbine becomes significantly important part of wind farms in order to cut down operation and maintenance costs. The large amount of CM system vibration data collected from wind turbines are posing challenges to operators in signal processing. It is crucial to design sensitive and reliable condition indicator (CI) in wind turbine CM system. Bearing plays an important role in wind turbine because of its high impact on downtime and component replacement. CIs for wind turbine bearing monitoring are reviewed in the paper, and the advantages and disadvantages of these indicators are discussed in detail. A new engineering CI (ECI), which combined the energy and kurtosis representation of the vibration signal, is proposed to meet the requirement of easy applicability and early detection in wind turbine bearing monitoring. The quantitative threshold setting method of the ECI is provided for wind turbine CM practice. The bearing run-to-failure experiment data analysis demonstrates that ECI can evaluate the overall condition and is sensitive to incipient fault of bearing. The effectiveness in engineering of ECI is validated though a certain amount of real-world wind turbine generator and gearbox bearing vibration data.

AB In view of the stability and safe service of the transmission system of the wind turbine, the trend early warning method for the stability deterioration of the electromechanical system is proposed and the level of the predictive maintenance of the complex electromechanical system is improved. It includes: establishing the dynamic model of wind power transmission system, revealing the evolution law of the system stability deterioration, putting forward the signal processing method of the weak detection information, extracting the fault features decoupling with energy and constructing the early warning methods of the system stability deterioration trend. The research results can be applied to the safety monitoring and fault warning of the wind turbine. It is beneficial to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the equipment and realise the prediction maintenance, improve the operation and management level of the equipment, reduce the economic loss caused by the failure and promote the utilisation and development of green energy.

AB Lubrication is one of the critical factors for the normal operation of wind turbine's gearbox, which carries abundant and various wear debris. Accordingly, these debris reflects the running state of the equipment and forecasts the early fault of wind turbine gearbox effectively. Thus, the authors can achieve predictive maintenance, even avoid the occurrence of safety accidents. In order to realise real-time online monitoring of lubrication, this article studied the principle of wear debris detection sensor, constructed approximate mathematical model of inductive wearing debris sensor, produced a prototype device, and carried out the monitoring test of metal wearing debris without oil. Experiment shown that the designed sensor can detect the signal of metal wear debris with the smallest diameter to 80 mu m, which can diagnose the early fault of the wind turbine.

AB Due to their high transmission ratio, high load carrying capacity and small size, planetary gears are widely used in the transmission systems of wind turbines. The planetary gearbox is the core of the transmission system of a wind turbine, but because of its special structure and complex internal and external excitation, the vibration signal spectrum shows strong nonlinearity, asymmetry and time variation, which brings great trouble to planetary gear fault diagnosis. The traditional time-frequency analysis technology is insufficient in the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of wind turbines. For this reason, we propose a new method of planetary gearbox fault diagnosis based on Compressive sensing, Two-dimensional variational mode decomposition (2D-VMD) and full-vector spectrum technology. Firstly, the nonlinear reconstruction and noise reduction of the signal is carried out by using compressed sensing, and then the signal with multiple degrees of freedom is adaptively decomposed into multiple sets of characteristic scale components by using 2D-VMD. Then, Renyi entropy is used as the optimization index of 2D-VMD analysis performance to extract the effective target intrinsic mode function (IMF) component, reconstruct the dynamics signal in the planetary gearbox, and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Then, using the full-vector spectrum technique, the homologous information collected by numerous sensors is data layer fused in the spatial domain and the time domain to increase the comprehensiveness and certainty of the fault information. Finally, the Teager-Kaiser energy operator is used to demodulate the potential low-frequency dynamics frequency characteristics from the high-frequency domain and detect the fault characteristic frequency. Furthermore, the correctness and validity of the method are verified by the fault test signal of the planetary gearbox.

AB Aimed at the problem that the signal data of wind turbine faulty gearbox is difficult to obtain and the health condition is difficult to diagnose under variable working conditions, a fault diagnosis method based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) multi-scale permutation entropy (MPE) and feature-based transfer learning (FTL) is proposed. According to the vibration signal characteristics of wind turbines, a series of mode components are obtained by transforming the signals under variable conditions. The MPE of the mode components is combined with the signal time domain features as a feature vector to be input into the transfer learning algorithm. The source domain and the target domain data belong to different working conditions, so the traditional machine learning methods are not ideal for fault classification. The method adopted in this paper minimizes the covariance between the source domain and the target domain through a linear transformation matrix, and reduces the difference of data distribution between the source domain and the target domain. Then, the feature vectors of the covariance-aligned source domain and the target domain are input into the support vector machine (SVM) for training and testing. Experiment shows that the proposed covariance alignment (COVAL) of fault features has higher accuracy in rolling bearing multi-state classification under variable working conditions compared with other methods.

AB The paper presents up-to-date multidisciplinary review of scientific knowledge and industrial guidelines concerning the issue of technical assessment of epicyclic gearboxes on the basis of vibrational measurement. The paper covers norms, patents, signal processing methods, technical features, diagnostic methodologies, and high-level soft computing. The review classifies recognized papers according to different aspects, like case difficulty, applied methods or studied objects. Moreover, the paper discusses recent development of diagnostic techniques taking into account changing operational conditions and requiring powerful data processing units not available hitherto. Since in recent years many partial review papers have been published in different journals, the current paper presents their individual scope. Because diagnostics of epicyclic gearboxes generally covers and extends the classical signal processing techniques and classical machine condition monitoring functionality, the current paper might serve as a descriptive database of sources of information and bibliography or as a reference to individual techniques.

   The proposed method can provide accurate wind turbine power curves even in the presence of outliers.
   Abstract A power curve of a wind turbine describes the nonlinear relationship between wind speed and the corresponding power output. It shows the generation performance of a wind turbine. It plays vital roles in wind power forecasting, wind energy potential estimation, wind turbine selection, and wind turbine condition monitoring. In this paper, a hybrid power curve modeling technique is proposed. First, fuzzy c-means clustering is employed to detect and remove outliers from the original wind data. Then, different extreme learning machines are trained with the processed data. The corresponding wind power forecasts can also be obtained with the trained models. Finally, support vector regression is used to take advantage of different forecasts from different models. The results show that (1) five-parameter logistic function is superior to the others among the parametric models; (2) generally, nonparametric power curve models perform better than parametric models; (3) the proposed hybrid model can generate more accurate power output estimations than the other compared models, thus resulting in better wind turbine power curves. Overall, the proposed hybrid strategy can also be applied in power curve modeling, and is an effective tool to get better wind turbine power curves, even when the collected wind data is corrupted by outliers.

AB Operations and maintenance tasks are critical to the reliability of a wind turbine. The state-of-the-art demonstrates the effectiveness of reliability centred maintenance, but there are no research studies that consider false alarms to reliability of the wind turbines. This paper presents a novel approach based on artificial neural networks to reliability centred maintenance. The methodology is employed for false alarm detection and prioritization, training the artificial neural networks over the time to increase the system reliability. The approach is applied to a real dataset from a supervisory control and data acquisition system together with a vibration monitoring system of a wind turbine. The results accuracy is done by confusion matrices, studding real alarms with the estimations provided by the approach, and the results are validated with real false alarms and compared by the results given by a fuzzy logic model. The method provides accuracy results (over 90%). A novelty is to use a two real dataset from a wind turbine to create a redundant response to detect false alarms by artificial neural networks.

AB Onshore and offshore wind farms require a high level of advanced maintenance. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and condition monitoring systems are now being employed, generating large amounts of data. They require robust and flexible approaches to convert dataset into useful information. This paper presents a novel approach based on the correlations of SCADA variables to detect and identify faults and false alarms in wind turbines. A correlation matrix between all the SCADA variables is used for pattern recognition. A new method based on curve fittings is employed for detecting false alarms and abnormal behaviours or faults in the components. The study is done in a real case study, validated with false alarms.

AB Health state assessment of wind turbine components has become a vital aspect of wind farm operations in order to reduce maintenance costs. The gearbox is one of the most costly components to replace and it is usually monitored through vibration condition monitoring. This study aims to present a review of the most popular existing gear vibration diagnostic methods. Features are extracted from the vibration signals based on each method and are used as input in pattern recognition algorithms. Classification of each signal is achieved based on its health state. This is demonstrated in a case study using historic vibration data acquired from operational wind turbines. The data collection starts from a healthy operating condition and leads towards a gear failure. The results of various diagnostic algorithms are compared based on their classification accuracy.

AB Ice accretion on wind turbine blades is one of the major faults affecting the operational safety and power generation efficiency of wind turbines. Current icing detection methods are based on either meteorological observing system or extra condition monitoring system. Compared with current methods, icing detection using the intrinsic supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data of wind turbines has plenty of potential advantages, such as low cost, high stability, and early icing detection ability. However, there have not been deep investigations in this field at present. In this paper, a novel intelligent wind turbine blade icing detection method based on the wind turbine SCADA data is proposed. This method consists of three processes: SCADA data preprocessing, automatic feature extraction, and ensemble icing detection model construction. Specifically, deep autoencoders network is employed to learn multilevel fault features from the complex SCADA data adaptively. And the ensemble technique is utilized to make full use of all the extracted features from different hidden layers of the deep autoencoders network to build the ensemble icing detection model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using the data collected from actual wind farms. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method is able to not only adaptively extract valuable fault features from the complex SCADA data, but also obtains higher detection accuracy and generalization capability compared with conventional machine learning models and individual deep learning model.

AB Nowadays wind energy production is growing fast, and the cost of operation and maintenance is growing fast also. Most wind turbines (WTs) are equipped with supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system for system control and logging data. Huge amounts of data acquired for SCADA systems can be used for condition monitoring and fault detection (CMDF) by applying data mining methods. However, the collected data are not used effectively. Few researches are about input and output data optimization and proper feature selection. In this paper, the proposed method regards SCADA data as data points. Wavelet analysis is applied to the input signal to make noise reduction and uses recursive least square (RLS) filter to reduce false alarm rate. On the basis of the general model-based CMDF approach, the random forest algorithm is used to find the best input features. With these methods applied, a more precise output is obtained as well and greatly reduces the false alarm rate as well. Experiments are given with real SCADA data to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB An important and strategic instrument in energy market is wind turbine (WT). WT consists of many components, whose operation and maintenance of them are very sensitive due to their unstable dynamic and environmental conditions. Condition monitoring (CM) and fault prognosis approaches are typical methods in order to decrease the production cost of energy and WT downtime. In this paper, a new combinatory system of CM and fault prognosis based on feature extraction and prediction algorithm is proposed. Firstly, 3 phase current signals are collected. In the next step, proper features selection is done in time and frequency domain. The CM operation is based on a feature amplitude value crossing of an alarm threshold. The fault prognosis is conducted with improved support vector machine (SVM) method. The least squares (LS) type of SVM method is used for fault prediction and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used for the optimum selection of SVM and kernel parameters. When the trend of fault symptom crosses through the specific alarm threshold, the prognostics unit is activated and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is performed using PSO-LSSVM. For a scenario of the fault, generator rotor winding failure based on rotor electrical asymmetry is created with different percentages in the doubly-fed induction generator. The effectiveness of the proposed prognosis structure is evaluated using a WT simulation setup. For this setup, a 2.5 Mw WT experimental data and equipment parameters are used. The statistical investigations show the precision of PSO-LSSVM in RUL prediction. The different simulations confirm that improved condition-based maintenance performances can be obtained.

AB Among the different maintenance techniques applied to wind turbine (WT) components, online condition monitoring is probably the most promising technique. The maintenance models based on online condition monitoring have been examined in many studies. However, no study has considered preventive maintenance models with incorporated probabilities of correct and incorrect decisions made during continuous condition monitoring. This article presents a mathematical model of preventive maintenance, with imperfect continuous condition monitoring of the WT components. For the first time, the article introduces generalized expressions for calculating the interval probabilities of false positive, true positive, false negative, and true negative when continuously monitoring the condition of a WT component. Mathematical equations that allow for calculating the expected cost of maintenance per unit of time and the average lifetime maintenance cost are derived for an arbitrary distribution of time to degradation failure. A numerical example of WT blades maintenance illustrates that preventive maintenance with online condition monitoring reduces the average lifetime maintenance cost by 11.8 times, as compared to corrective maintenance, and by at least 4.2 and 2.6 times, compared with predetermined preventive maintenance for low and high crack initiation rates, respectively.

AB Condition monitoring can improve the reliability of wind turbines, which can effectively reduce operation and maintenance costs. The temperature prediction model of wind turbine gearbox components is of great significance for monitoring the operation status of the gearbox. However, the complex operating conditions of wind turbines pose grand challenges to predict the temperature of gearbox components. In this study, an online hybrid model based on a long short term memory (LSTM) neural network and adaptive error correction (LSTM-AEC) using simple-variable data is proposed. In the proposed model, a more suitable deep learning approach for time series, LSTM algorithm, is applied to realize the preliminary prediction of temperature, which has a stronger ability to capture the non-stationary and non-linear characteristics of gearbox components temperature series. In order to enhance the performance of the LSTM prediction model, the adaptive error correction model based on the variational mode decomposition (VMD) algorithm is developed, where the VMD algorithm can effectively solve the prediction difficulty issue caused by the non-stationary, high-frequency and chaotic characteristics of error series. To apply the hybrid model to the online prediction process, a real-time rolling data decomposition process based on VMD algorithm is proposed. With aims to validate the effectiveness of the hybrid model proposed in this paper, several traditional models are introduced for comparative analysis. The experimental results show that the hybrid model has better prediction performance than other comparative models.

AB One of the greatest challenges of optimising the correct operation of wind turbines is detecting the health status of their core components, such as gearboxes in particular. Gearbox monitoring is a widely studied topic in the literature, nevertheless, studies showing data of in-service wind turbines are less frequent and tend to present difficulties that are otherwise overlooked in test rig based works. This work presents the data of three wind turbines that have gearboxes in different damage stages. Besides including the data of the SCADA (Supervisory Control And Signal Acquisition) system, additional measurements of online optical oil debris sensors are also included. In addition to an analysis of the behaviour of particle generation in the turbines, a methodology to identify regimes of operation with lower variation is presented. These regimes are later utilised to develop a health index that considers operation states and provides valuable information regarding the state of the gearboxes. The proposed health index allows distinguishing damage severity between wind turbines as well as tracking the evolution of the damage over time.

AB Effective intelligent condition monitoring, as an effective technique to enhance the reliability of wind turbines and implement cost-effective maintenance, has been the object of extensive research and development to improve defect detection from supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data, relying on perspective signal processing and statistical algorithms. The development of sophisticated machine learning now allows improvements in defect detection from historic data. This paper proposes a novel condition monitoring method for wind turbines based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms. LSTM algorithms have the capability of capturing long-term dependencies hidden within a sequence of measurements, which can be exploited to increase the prediction accuracy. LSTM algorithms are therefore suitable for application in many diverse fields. The residual signal obtained by comparing the predicted values from a prediction model and the actual measurements from SCADA data can be used for condition monitoring. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in the case study. The proposed method can increase the economic benefits and reliability of wind farms.

AB Pitch systems are one of the components with the most frequent failure in wind turbines. This paper presents a two-stage fault detection and classification scheme for electric motor drives in wind turbine pitch systems. The presented approach is suitable for application in offshore wind farms with electric pitch systems driven by induction motors as well as permanent magnet synchronous motors. The adopted strategy utilizes three-phase motor current sensing at the pitch drives for fault detection and only when a fault condition is detected at this stage, features extracted from the current signals are transmitted to a support vector machine classifier located centrally to the wind farm. The proposed method is validated in an in-house setup of the pitch drive.

AB Gaussian Process (GP) models are increasingly finding application in wind turbine condition monitoring and in particular early fault detection. GP model accuracy is greatly influenced by the choice and type of the covariance functions (used to described the similarity between two given data points). Hence, the appropriate selection and composition of covariance functions is essential for accurate GP modelling.
   In this study, an in-depth analysis of commonly used stationary covariance functions is presented in which wind turbine power curve used where GP based power curve has been constructed using different stationary covariance functions, and after that, a comparative analysis has been carried out in order to identify the most effective covariance function. The commonly used squared exponential covariance function is taken as the benchmark, against which other covariance functions are assessed.
   The results show that the performance (in terms of model accuracy and uncertainty) of GP fitted power curve models based on rational quadratic covariance functions is almost the same as for the most commonly used squared exponential function. Thus, rational quadratic covariance functions can be used instead of squared exponential covariance functions. In this paper, strength and weakness of stationary covariance functions would be highlighted for effective condition monitoring. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The power curve of a wind turbine describes the generated power versus instantaneous wind speed. wind turbine performance under laboratory ideal conditions will always tend to be optimistic rarely reflects how the turbine actually behaves in a real situation. Occasionally, some aerogenerators significantly different from nominal power curve, causing economic losses to the promoters of investment. Our research aims to model actual wind turbine power curve and its variation from power curve. The study was carried out in three different phases starting from wind speed and power production data of a Senvion MM92 aero-generator with a rated power of 2.05 MW. The phase was focused on statistical analyses, using the most common and reliable probability density The second phase was focused on the analysis and modelling of real power curves obtained on during one year of operation by fitting processes on real production data. The third was focused on development of a model based on the use of an Artificial Neural Networks that can predict the of delivered power. The actual power curve modelled with a multi-layered neural network was with nominal characteristics and the performances assessed by the turbine SCADA. For the device, deviations are below 1% for the producibility and below 0.5% for the actual power curves with both methods. The model can be used for any wind turbine to verify real performances to check fault conditions helping operators in understanding normal and abnormal behaviour. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In North America, many utility-scale turbines are approaching, or are beyond the half-way point of their originally anticipated lifespan. Accurate estimation of the times to failure of major turbine components can provide wind farm owners insight into how to optimise the life and value of their farm assets. In this study, data records from a wind farm have been used to estimate the reliability of wind turbine (WT) generators. For this study, non-parametric life data analysis, Weibull Standard Folio life data analysis, and ALTA Standard Folio life data analysis have been used to predict the reliability of the generators. The naive prediction interval procedure also has been used here to provide an approximate range for the remaining life of each generator. This study provides some insight into how reliable a subset of WT generators is and the lifetime distribution of individual generators. These outcomes may be leveraged further by the research community for companion applications like prognostic maintenance and investment decision support systems. This study also begins to investigate how electrical loads may influence turbine generator reliability. The work also illustrates a valuable example of how to estimate component remaining useful life based on truncated/limited data records.

ID MODEL
AB In order to reduce the curse of dimensionality of massive data from SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system and remove data redundancy, the grey correlation algorithm is used to extract the eigenvectors of monitoring data. The eigenvectors are used as input vectors and the monitoring variables related to the unit state as output vectors. The genetic algorithm and cross validation method are used to optimize the parameters of the support vector regression (SVR) model. A high precision prediction is carried out, and a reasonable threshold is set up to alarm the fault. The condition monitoring of the wind turbine is realized. The effectiveness of the method is verified by using the actual fault data of a wind farm.

AB Although the discrete wavelet transform has been used for diagnosing bearing faults for two decades, most work in this field has been done with test rig data. Since field data starts to be made more available, there is a need to shift into application studies. The choice of mother wavelet, ie, the predefined shape used to analyse the signal, has previously been investigated with simulated and test rig data without consensus of optimal choice in literature. Common between these investigations is the use of the wavelet coefficients' Shannon entropy to find which mother wavelet can yield the most useful features for condition monitoring. This study attempts to find the optimal mother wavelet selection using the discrete wavelet transform. Datasets from wind turbine gearbox accelerometers, consisting of enveloped vibration measurements monitoring both healthy and faulty bearings, have been analysed. The bearing fault frequencies' excitation level has been analysed with 130 different mother wavelets, yielding a definitive measure on their performance. Also, the applicability of Shannon entropy as a ranking method of mother wavelets has been investigated. The results show the discrete wavelet transforms ability to identify faults regardless of mother wavelet used, with the excitation level varying no more than 4%. By analysing the Shannon entropy, broad predictions to the excitation level could be drawn within the mother wavelet families but no direct correlation to the main results. Also, the high computational effort of high order Symlet wavelets, without increased performance, makes them unsuitable.

AB Reducing wind turbine downtime through innovations surrounding asset management has the potential to greatly influence the levelised cost of energy (LCoE) for large wind farm developments. Focusing on generator bearing failure and vibration data, this paper presents a two-stage methodology to predict failure within 1 to 2 months of occurrence. Results are obtained by building up a database of failures and training machine learning algorithms to classify the bearing as healthy or unhealthy. This is achieved by first using clustering techniques to produce subpopulations of data based on operating conditions, which this paper demonstrates can greatly influence the ability to diagnose a fault. Secondly, this work classifies individual clusters as healthy or unhealthy from vibration-based condition monitoring systems by applying order analysis techniques to extract features. Using the methodology explained in the report, an accuracy of up to 81.6% correct failure prediction was achieved.

AB Condition monitoring is used to assess the reliability and equipment efficiency of wind turbines. Feature extraction is an essential preprocessing step to achieve a high level of performance in condition monitoring. However, the fluctuating conditions of wind turbines usually cause sudden variations in the monitored features, which may lead to an inaccurate prediction and maintenance schedule. In this scenario, this article proposed a novel methodology to detect the multiple levels of faults of rolling bearings in variable operating conditions. First, signal decomposition was carried out by variational mode decomposition (VMD). Second, the statistical features were calculated and extracted in the time domain. Meanwhile, a permutation entropy analysis was conducted to estimate the complexity of the vibrational signal in the time series. Next, feature selection techniques were applied to achieve improved identification accuracy and reduce the computational burden. Finally, the ranked feature vectors were fed into machine learning algorithms for the classification of the bearing defect status. In particular, the proposed method was performed over a wide range of working regions to simulate the operational conditions of wind turbines. Comprehensive experimental investigations were employed to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB A new optimal maintenance policy considering the condition monitoring and age information is considered for a two-unit repairable system. Unit 1 is the core component of the system, which is subject to soft failure observed only through inspections. Unit 2 is subject to hard failure and the age information representing usage of unit 2 is available. Unlike the previous maintenance models where maintenance actions can be initiated only at the inspection epochs, we assume that corrective maintenance action would be carried out immediately when unit 2 fails. Furthermore, a preventive maintenance is performed on the units if the deterioration level of unit 1 or the usage of unit 2 exceeds certain maintenance threshold for that unit. Under this maintenance strategy, when one of the two units is correctively or preventively maintained, there is an opportunity to maintain the other unit. The maintenance problem is formulated and solved in the semi-Markov decision process framework. A formula for the average maintenance cost is derived and the optimal thresholds for preventive and opportunistic maintenance of the two units minimizing the long run expected average cost are determined. A practical example of a two-unit wind turbine system is provided, and a comparison analysis with other maintenance policies shows an outstanding performance of the proposed policy.

ID TURBINE PERFORMANCE
AB As utility scale wind farms age, maintenance and contingency planning become increasingly important. Decisions about when and how to repair or replace major turbine components can critically influence profitability. Condition monitoring and prognostic reliability modelling are sometimes used to support these decision-making processes. These often resource intensive, sophisticated techniques are frequently administered by third parties and can be black boxes to wind farm stakeholders. Early experience from the YR21 Investment Decision Support Program has highlighted the importance of broad engagement across wind farm teams in maintenance and planning discussions. The utilization of geographic information systems to illustrate data trends across wind farms proved to be a valuable tool in fostering fundamental understanding of an operation's signature performance characteristics. This graphical representation of the farm provides a useful visualization of the operation's best and worst performers in terms of power produced, wind speeds experienced, total revolutions, or highest gear box temperature. These transparent representations of the data represent valuable starting points for discussion of performance or potential maintenance issues across farms. In some cases, it can reveal unexpected trends that may raise bigger questions about how the farm is operating in general. Finally, these simple figures can serve as complementary inputs to larger, more complex data-driven decision systems. Geographic information system plots are presented for three wind farms to demonstrate the potential utility in simple, transparent, and accessible data visualization.

AB Deployment of large-scale wind turbines requires sophisticated operation and maintenance strategies to ensure the devices are safe, profitable and cost-effective. Prognostics aims to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of physical systems based on condition measurements. Analyzing condition monitoring data, implementing diagnostic techniques and using machinery prognostic algorithms will bring about accurate estimation of the remaining life and possible failures that may occur. This paper proposes to combine two supervised machine learning techniques, namely, regression model and multilayer artificial neural network model, to predict the RUL of an operational wind turbine gearbox using vibration measurements. Root Mean Square (RMS), Kurtosis (KU) and Energy Index (EI) were analysed to define the bearing failure stages. The proposed methodology was evaluated through a case study involving vibration measurements of a high-speed shaft bearing used in a wind turbine gearbox.

AB Components of rotating machines, such as shafts, bearings and gears are subject to performance degradation, which if left unattended could lead to failure or breakdown of the entire system. Analyzing condition monitoring data, implementing diagnostic techniques and using machinery prognostic algorithms will bring about accurate estimation of the remaining life and possible failures that may occur. This paper proposes a combination of two supervised machine learning techniques; namely, the regression model and multilayer artificial neural network model, to predict the remaining useful life of rolling element bearings. Root mean square and Kurtosis were analyzed to define the bearing failure stages. The proposed methodology was validated through two case studies involving vibration measurements of an operational wind turbine gearbox and a split cylindrical roller bearing in a test rig.

AB Power curve plays a vital role in design, operation, control, and condition monitoring of wind turbines. Especially, it provides necessary information for wind farm maintenance decisions, allowing for not only comparison among the same type of wind turbines installed in different places, but also the same one at different time stamps. A standardized power curve iterative modeling procedure of wind turbines is proposed based on actual supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data for performance evaluation in an online manner with guaranteed smoothness. The data are firstly preprocessed for anomaly detection by following normalization correction and then sliced into different wind speed bins. The least-square B-spline approximation method is iteratively implemented for power curve construction based on dominant points selected from the bin centroids, and turbulence intensity correction and outlier detection are conducted iteratively for refining identification results. Finally, the test results based on actual operating SCADA data demonstrate better performance in comparison with two counterparts.

AB High operation and maintenance costs for offshore wind turbines push up the LCOE of offshore wind energy. Unscheduled maintenance due to unanticipated failures is the most prominent driver of the maintenance cost which reinforces the drive towards condition-based maintenance. SCADA based condition monitoring is a cost-effective approach where power curve used to assess the performance of a wind turbine. Such power curves are useful in identification of wind turbine abnormal behaviour. IEC standard 61400-12-1 outlines the guidelines for power curve modelling based on binning. However, establishing such a power curve takes considerable time and is far too slow to reflect changes in performance to be used directly for condition monitoring. To address this, data-driven, nonparametric models being used instead. Gaussian Process models and regression trees are commonly used nonlinear, nonparametric models useful in forecasting and prediction applications. In this paper, two nonparametric methods are proposed for power curve modelling. The Gaussian Process treated as the benchmark model, and a comparative analysis was undertaken using a Regression tree model; the advantages and limitations of each model will be outlined. The performance of these regression models is validated using readily available SCADA datasets from a healthy wind turbine operating under normal conditions.

AB Innovations which help facilitate predictive maintenance strategies have the potential to greatly reduce costs associated with wind turbine O&M by driving efficiency and increasing wind turbine availability. This study uses multiple examples of the same generator bearing failure to provide insight into how condition monitoring systems can be used in to train machine learning algorithms with the ultimate goal of predicting failure and remaining useful life. Results show that by analysing high-frequency vibration data and extracting key features to train support vector machine algorithms, an accuracy of 67% can be achieved in successfully predicting failure 1-2 months before occurrence. This study reflects on the limitations surrounding a generalised training approach, taking advantage of all available data, showing that if too many different examples are considered of different wind turbines and operating conditions, the overall accuracy can be diminished.

AB The wind industry is showing increasing awareness about the importance of long-term direct shaft mechanical torque measurements to fully understand wind turbine (WT) dynamics, adopt proactive solutions for extreme load mitigation and enhance condition monitoring (CM) capabilities. Although torsional effects are important, torque measurement on such large, inaccessible machines is practically and logistically difficult, mainly because of the costly and intrusive specialised equipment currently available. This study details an experimental set-up for the investigation of shaft dynamic transient load and speed measurements through a contactless, low-cost torque meter. Results are obtained over a range of applied loads and compared with reference measurements from an in-line, invasive torque transducer. Average torque and speed root-mean-square error values of 0.53Nm and 0.35rpm, respectively, indicate good accuracy of the proposed contactless torque meter. Its implementation in the field would allow direct, cheap, real-time measurements of WT drive train loads for performance monitoring, control and CM purposes.

AB Wind power is playing an increasingly significant role in daily life. However, wind farms are usually far away from cities especially for offshore wind farms, which brought inconvenience for maintenance. Two conventional maintenance strategies, namely corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance, cannot provide condition-based maintenance to identify potential anomalies and predicts turbines' future operation trend. In this study, a model based data-driven condition monitoring method is proposed for fault detection of the wind turbines (WTs) with SCADA data acquired from an operational wind farm. Due to the nature of the alarm signals, the alarm data can be used as an intermedium to link the normal data and fault data. First, KPCA is employed to select principal components (PCs) to retain the dominant information from the original dataset to reduce the computation load for further modelling. Then the selected PCs are processed for normal-abnormal condition classification to extract those abnormal condition data that are classified further into false alarms and true alarms related to the faults. This two-stage classification approach is implemented based on the KSVM algorithm. The results demonstrate that the two-stage fault detection method can identify the normal, alarm and fault conditions of the WTs accurately and effectively.

AB This study presents a method of anomaly detection within a gearbox by way of standardising temperature data. Assessing measured parameters in isolation is not sufficient to detect faults within a wind turbine. This technique uses temperature, rotational speed, and generator torque to detect a bearing fault within the gearbox. Standardising data allows a parameter to be analysed which also takes into consideration the operating state of the wind turbine, therefore providing a more holistic view of the health of the wind turbine and component being monitored.

The model was optimised and partially validated using experimental data from a wind turbine drivetrain test rig. The model was then used to mimic bearing faults, by simulating additional heat losses at respective faulty components. The extent to which the thermal behaviour changed as a result of a fault was studied, with a view to use such an approach to detect and locate faults.

AB The reduction of operation and maintenance cost plays a significant role in decreasing the cost of energy generated by offshore wind farm, which can be realized through better design of maintenance strategy. This paper proposes a dynamic opportunistic condition-based maintenance strategy for offshore wind farm by using predictive analytics. In the strategy, a new maintenance basis is developed by considering the varying maintenance lead time to make maintenance decisions for different wind turbine components. Meanwhile, the strategy also considers the economic dependence between the wind turbines and the components. We then present a maintenance model to derive the optimal maintenance plans for various turbine components under different weather and operation load conditions. A numerical example is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the maintenance model. It is found that the varying maintenance lead time has a significant effect on the annual maintenance cost which demonstrates the reasonableness of our proposed maintenance basis. Compared to the widely employed and the simple maintenance strategies, the proposed strategy can help reduce the annual maintenance cost by 39.24% and 32.46% respectively.

AB During its service life, a wind turbine has to withstand very challenging loads and severe environmental factors which can cause some deteriorations and cracks on structural components. Yearly periodic controls may not be sufficient to diagnose a fault at early stages. Therefore, wind turbines are very important systems which have to be monitored continuously. This work aims at developing an automated scanning system for IR (Infrared) laser vibrometers to conduct the tests and measurements, which are required for condition monitoring, in a more accurate and efficient manner. Unlike visible green or red lasers, IR laser is reflected by most surfaces (especially by blade material) with a very high intensity without needing a preparation or surface enhancement on the target. However, IR laser cannot be guided by refracting/reflecting the beam by lenses and mirrors used by conventional laser scanners. This work proposes a new methodology which is based on mounting the laser source on a motorized platform and then rotating the platform rather than guiding the laser beam by optical systems. The tests performed by using wind turbine models show that the proposed system is capable of guiding the laser to the desired measurement points with very high precision and efficiency. The results of the analyses also show that some important dynamic characteristics of the system such as Eigenfrequencies and mode shapes can be extracted very accurately.

ID SYNTHETIC CONDITION ASSESSMENT; SCADA DATA
AB As the running time of a wind turbine generator unit (WTGU) increases, the ageing and wear of its components will be aggravated gradually, which leads to deterioration of its operation condition. In order to ensure the safe and stable operation of WTGU and prolong its service life, it is of great significance to know the health condition of the WTGU and reasonably arrange maintenance. Based on the structure of the WTGU and the operation principle of the wind turbine generator (WTG), the condition assessment indexes of WTG were built, and the factors influencing the assessment index were determined. The relationship function between the assessment indexes and their influencing factors was established by using the least square support vector machine, which was used to determine the dynamic limitation of condition assessment index of WTG. The dynamic weight of each assessment index was used to characterise the influence of deterioration degree of different components on WTG conditions. Then the health conditions of WTG were evaluated using a similar cloud and fuzzy comprehensive assessment method separately. Finally, the proposed methods were verified by two examples including a direct-drive permanent magnet wind generator and a doubly-fed wind generator.

AB This article presents the development of a low power aerogenerator prototype implemented in a test bench. The objective is to design a system that allows to simulate faults usually encountered in high power wind turbines. A SCADA system is implemented that monitors vibration, temperature, speed, currents and voltages in the different parts of the wind turbine prototype. This SCADA system allows the application of condition monitoring techniques, fault detection and diagnosis of several wind turbine conditions. A fault tree methodology is applied to diagnose different faults. With the obtained results we can conclude that this test system allows validation of monitoring and diagnostic techniques to be applied in high power wind turbines.

AB Continuous monitoring of wind turbine (WT) operation can improve the reliability of the wind turbine and lower the operation and maintenance costs. To improve the condition monitoring (CM) and fault detection performance on WTs, this paper proposes an artificial intelligence-based probabilistic anomaly detection approach that can not only provide a deterministic estimation of the WT condition but also evaluate the uncertainties associated with the estimation. An abnormal WT condition is detected based on the evaluated uncertainties, to provide a noise-free incipient fault indication. Compared to the conventional deterministic CM approaches with a residual-based anomaly detection criterion, the proposed probabilistic approach tends to accurately detect the faults earlier, which allows more time for maintenance scheduling to prevent WT component failure. The early fault detection ability of the proposed approach was verified on an operational WT in China.

AB Monitoring the thermal behavior of distributed energy resources (DERs) network explores the dualism between thermal effects and electrical power flow. This paper proposes a design concept that monitors thermal conditions of DER grids, using ZigBee/GSM wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for real-time monitoring in rural and remote areas. The concept seeks to improve upon existing designs by integrating composite functions. The functions comprise temperature conditions monitoring, data acquisition, and wireless data transmission including data storage and abnormal conditions alert/notification for control solutions. Thus, the concept determines the thermal impact on the DERs integrated network. WSNs with temperature sensors LM35 are utilized to complement ZigBee and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) technologies as a communication assisted link. Temperatures are measured from solar Photovoltaic PV modules, wind turbine, distribution cables, protection control units, and energy storage facilities. The ATMEGA328P microcontroller is assigned for signal and control processing. The circuit performance is coordinated and displayed on an LCD screen for normal conditions, whereas abnormal scenarios communicate through an alert/notification by GSM Short Message Service (SMS) protocol. The development analysis was performed through algorithm and circuit simulations. Proteus software was used for circuit design. Both the algorithm and circuit analysis passed the assigned simulation stages.

AB The vibration measured from wind turbine drivetrain components is a mixture of multiple frequency modes. In practice, in wind turbine drivetrain condition monitoring systems, multiple accelerometer sensors are used to measure the vibration. Inter-channel common modes are not processed in the standard single-channel empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and it suffers from mode mixing and mode misalignment. Inter-channel correlation implies the causation of vibration mode shapes. Multivariate EMD (MEMD) possesses an enhanced spatial and spectral coherence. The mode alignment property of MEMD is used to process the inter-channel common modes, thus MEMD overcomes the limitation of mode misalignment in single-channel EMD. Still, MEMD exhibits a degree of mode mixing. White noise powers are added in separate channels to lessen the mode mixing. In this research, a novel multivariate signal processing technique, noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode signal decomposition (NA-MEMD) with a competent nonlinear Teager-Kaiser energy operator (NLTKEO), is proposed and tested for truthful extraction of instantaneous frequency and instantaneous amplitude features, and thereby ensures superior fault diagnosis performance. The dyadic filter bank structure of the proposed NA-MEMD decomposes the non-stationary vibrations effectively. The proposed method is used to predict the surface damage pattern embedded in multi-source vibrations at a low-speed planetary gear stage. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is tested with NREL GRC wind turbine condition monitoring benchmark datasets.

AB A two-stage approach for precisely detecting wind turbine blade surface cracks via analyzing blade images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach includes two main detection procedures, the crack location and crack contour detection. In locating cracks, a method for extracting crack windows based on extended Haar-like features is introduced. A parallel sliding window method is developed to scan images and the cascading classifier is developed to classify sliding windows into two classes, crack and noncrack. Based on detected windows containing cracks, a novel clustering algorithm, the parallel Jaya K-means algorithm, is developed to assign each pixel in crack windows into crack and noncrack segments. Crack contours are obtained based on boundaries of crack segments. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed crack detection approach are validated by executing it on a personal computer and an embedded device with UAV-taken images collected from a commercial wind farm. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed approach can successfully identify both the blade crack locations and crack contours in UAV taken images.

AB Planetary gearboxes are widely used in the drivetrain of wind turbines. Planetary gearbox fault diagnosis is very important for reducing the downtime and maintenance cost and improving the safety, reliability, and life span of the wind turbines. The wind energy industry is currently using condition monitoring systems to collect massive real-time data and conventional vibratory analysis as a standard method for planetary gearbox condition monitoring. As an attractive option to process big data for fault diagnosis, deep learning can automatically learn features that otherwise require much skill, time, and experience. This article presents a new deep-learning-based method for wind turbine planetary gearbox fault diagnosis developed by a large memory storage and retrieval neural network with dictionary learning. The developed approach can automatically extract self-learned fault features from raw vibration monitoring data and perform planetary gearbox fault diagnosis without supervised fine-tuning process. From the raw vibration monitoring data, a dictionary is first learned by a large memory storage and retrieval with dictionary learning network. Based on the learned dictionary, a sparse representation of the raw vibration signals is generated by shift-invariant sparse coding and input to a large memory storage and retrieval network classifier to obtain fault diagnosis results. The structure of the large memory storage and retrieval with dictionary learning is determined by optimal selection of the sliding box size to generate sub-patterns from the vibration data. The effectiveness of the presented method is tested and validated with a set of seeded fault vibration data collected at a planetary gearbox test rig in laboratory. The validation results have shown a promising planetary gearbox fault diagnosis performance with the presented method.

AB The unexpected failure of wind turbine components leads to significant downtime and loss of revenue. To prevent this, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) based condition monitoring is considered as a cost-effective approach. In several studies, the wind turbine power curve has been used as a critical indicator for power performance assessment. In contrast, the application of the blade pitch angle curve has hardly been explored for wind turbine condition monitoring purposes. The blade pitch angle curve describes the nonlinear relationship between pitch angle and hub height wind speed and can be used for the detection of faults. A support vector machine (SVM) is an improved version of an artificial neural networks (ANN) and is widely used for classification- and regression-related problems. Support vector regression is a data-driven approach based on statistical learning theory and a structural risk minimization principle which provides useful nonlinear system modeling. In this paper, a support vector regression (a nonparametric machine learning approach)-based pitch curve is presented and its application to anomaly detection explored for wind turbine condition monitoring. A radial basis function (RBF) was used as the kernel function for effective SVR blade pitch curve modeling. This approach is then compared with a binned pitch curve in the identification of operational anomalies. The paper will outline the advantages and limitations of these techniques.

AB Rolling element bearing faults of a laboratory scale wind turbine gearbox operating under nonstationary loads have been diagnosed using condition monitoring (CM) techniques such as vibration analysis, acoustic analysis, and lubrication oil analysis. Two local bearing faults, namely, bearing inner race fault and bearing outer fault are seeded in the gearbox. The raw data from these techniques are decomposed and wavelet approximation coefficients of level four (a4) are extracted using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). A plethora of statistical features is computed from the wavelet approximation coefficients and the most significant features are being identified by implementing the decision tree algorithm. The classification efficiencies of each of these CM techniques are compared by using the support-vector machine algorithm. Furthermore, an integrated CM scheme is developed by combining the individual CM techniques and the fault diagnosing ability of the integrated CM scheme is compared with the individual CM techniques. A principal component analysis-based approach is used as a feature classification algorithm and an input feature matrix is formed by combining the significant features extracted from vibration, acoustic, and lubrication oil analysis. It has been observed that the integrated CM scheme has provided better classification interpretations than the single CM techniques and it can be extended for real time fault diagnosis of a wind turbine gearbox.

AB With the increasing installed power of the wind turbines, the necessity of condition monitoring for wind turbine drivetrain cannot be neglected any longer. A reliable and rapid response fault diagnosis is vital for the wind turbine drivetrain system. The existing manual inspection-based methods are difficult to accomplish the real-time compound-fault monitoring task. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel dual extreme learning machines (Dual-ELMs) based fault diagnostic framework for feature extraction and fault pattern recognition. At the stage of feature learning, this paper applies the local mean decomposition (LMD) method to extract the production functions from the raw vibration signals. Compared with the traditional empirical mode decomposition method, the LMD method has a stronger ability to restrain the mode mixing and endpoints effect. At the stage of compound-fault classification, unlike the other widely-used classifiers, the proposed Dual-ELM networks inherit the advantages of the original extreme learning machines (ELMs), that employs two basic ELM networks for the compound-fault classification, and it does not need iterative fine-tuning of parameters. Thus the learning speed is faster than the other combinations of classifiers. The experimental validity of the proposed algorithm was conducted on a test rig for vibration analysis, which demonstrated that the proposed Dual-ELMs based fault diagnostic method provides an effective measure for the observed machinery than the other available fault diagnostic methods in aspects of feature extraction and compound-fault recognition.

AB Health and condition monitoring of composite structures are critical in engineering especially in the wind, civil, aviation, and auto industries. However, considering the geometry and size of the structures, analyzing critical locations can become challenging. Traditional sensors such as strain-gauges are widely used to collect operating data, but these conventional methods cannot present full-field data and only show the measurement data at a few discrete locations. Baqersad and Bharadwaj have recently developed a Strain Expansion-Reduction Approach (SERA) to bridge this gap and to expand a limited set of measurements and obtain full-field strain data. This approach uses the strain mode shapes from Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to develop a transformation matrix that expands the limited strain data measured using strain-gauges and predicts full-field strain over the entire structure. However, for many structures, it is challenging to accurately model the geometry or material properties for finite element analysis. Many of these structures are made of composite materials and material modes for these structures might not be readily available. In this paper, we use the strain mode shapes extracted using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) in the expansion process. These mode shapes represent actual properties of the structures. The strain mode shapes for a sample structure of a product can be extracted in a test facility using this approach (e.g., a wind turbine blade or a suspension A-arm). An in situ limited set of measurement can be performed using strain-gauges or fiber optic sensors on the structure. Then, the limited data can be expanded using the strain mode shapes to extract full-field strain results. To demonstrate the merit of the approach, we applied the proposed technique to expand real-time operating data measured using a few strain-gauges mounted to a composite spoiler. Using a transformation matrix generated using the DIC operating deflection shapes, the expansion technique predicted the full field strain on the spoiler. It was shown that the proposed methodology could effectively expand the strain data at limited locations to accurately predict the strain at locations where no sensors were placed.

AB This work has been developed within the framework of non-stationary rotating machinery surveillance with emphasis on the detection of rolling element bearing defects. The numerical models proposed in this paper are based on an "angular" approach which introduces explicitly the machine's free body rotation degrees of freedom allowing simulations in non-stationary operating conditions. In a previous work, a deep groove ball bearing model has been presented considering the rolling resistance phenomena, allowing to describe the angular speed variations due to the bearing dynamics, a phenomenon that has been detected experimentally. In this work, a classic gear mesh description together with the rolling element bearing defects model have been used to build a wind turbine virtual machine. The model is used as a device to test Instantaneous Angular Speed spectral indicators. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study, condition monitoring techniques such as vibration analysis, acoustic signal analysis and lubricating oil analysis are performed to early detect two failures of a wind turbine gear box such as tooth chip breakage and tooth root crack. A laboratory scale model of a three-stage spur gear system is tested under stationary and non-stationary loads and the response is captured through accelerometers and microphones. Wavelet analysis is performed to extract the features from the signals. Various statistical features are extracted and the dominant features are selected from it by using a decision tree algorithm. The selected features are then used for computing the classification accuracies through support vector machine. It has been observed that vibration signals at stationary loads and acoustic signals at non-stationary loads detect the early failure accurately. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Detecting and determining which systems or subsystems of a wind turbine have more failures is essential to improve their design, which will reduce the costs of generating wind power. Two of the most critical failures, the generator and gearbox, are analyzed and characterized with four metrics. This failure analysis usually begins with the identification of the turbine's condition, a process normally performed by an expert examining the wind turbine's service history. This is a time-consuming task, as a human expert has to examine each service entry. To automate this process, a new methodology is presented here, which is based on a set of steps to preprocess and decompose the service history to find relevant words and sentences that discriminate an unhealthy wind turbine period from a healthy one. This is achieved by means of two classifiers fed with the matrix of terms from the decomposed document of the training wind turbines. The classifiers can extract essential words and determine the conditions of new turbines of unknown status using the text from the service history, emulating what a human expert manually does when labelling the training set. Experimental results are promising, with accuracy and F-score above 90% in some cases. Condition monitoring system can be improved and automated using this system, which helps the expert in the tedious task of identifying the relevant words from the turbine service history. In addition, the system can be retrained when new knowledge becomes available and may therefore always be as accurate as a human expert. With this new tool, the expert can focus on identifying which systems or subsystems can be redesigned to increase the efficiency of wind turbines.

AB Fault detection in wind turbine which is identified with complete system monitoring under multi-fault scenario is proposed. When a fault is detected, its types and location are recognized for easy maintenance. Fault in wind turbines is caused due to the high speed of gearbox, generator bearing and the failures occurred in various parts. In wind farm, wind turbine condition monitoring is used to reduce the maintenance cost and also improves the accuracy. Generally, in wind turbine gearbox condition monitoring using sensor is a gainful method to monitor wind turbine performance and fault. This paper nominates a method to decide the parameters for support vector machine (SVM) in wind turbine called Cuckoo search optimization (CSO). The combination of optimization technique with classification technique is evaluated. MATLAB platform was used to evaluate the various faults under fixed value and gain factor conditions. Comparing the accuracy with SVM, particle swarm optimized SVM and k-nearest neighbor, the proposed fault detection and fault isolation technique (CSO-SVM) is improved by 2.5%, 3.5% and 6.5%, respectively. The result shows the CSO model based on SVM algorithm accomplishes the most accurate fault detection than the past models.

AB With the development of condition monitoring technology, the data collected by sensors are voluminous and much faster than before. The cloud computing technology is a good solution for big data processing, it is therefore very suitable to be applied in the condition monitoring of the wind turbine, especially for data-driven model-based condition monitoring methods. In order to solve this problem, a novel wind turbine condition monitoring method based on cloud computing is proposed in this paper. A data-driven model-based condition monitoring (CM) method by using hierarchical extreme learning machine (HELM) algorithm is adopted to achieve fault detection of the gearbox in the wind turbine, which has better performance than traditional ELM method. Then, compressed sensing (CS) method is applied to compress the first hidden layer output that will be uploaded to the cloud for further calculation. The proposed method is not only able to detect the faults effectively, but also considering data upload quantity reduction and data security. The case study validates the effectiveness of the proposed method. Consequently, it is effective and can also enhance economic benefit and operating efficiency of the wind farm.

AB This paper presents real-time monitoring data and analysis results of the non-stationary vibrations of an operational wind turbine. The advanced time-frequency spectrum analysis reveals varied non-stationary vibrations with timevarying frequencies, which are correlated with certain system natural modes characterized by finite element analysis. Under the effects of strong wind load, the wind turbine system exhibits certain resonances due to blade passing excitations. The system also exhibits certain instabilities due to the coupling of the tower bending modes and blade flapwise mode with blade passing excitations under the variation of wind speed. An analytical model is used to elaborate the non-stationary and instability phenomena observed in experimental results. The properties of the nonlinear instabilities are evaluated by using Lyapunov exponent estimation.

ID SYSTEM
AB The monitoring of wind turbines using SCADA data has received lately a growing interest from the fault diagnosis community because of the very low cost of these data, which are available in number without the need for any additional sensor. Yet, these data are highly variable due to the turbine constantly changing its operating conditions and to the rapid fluctuations of the environmental conditions (wind speed and direction, air density, turbulence, ...). This makes the occurrence of a fault difficult to detect. To address this problem, we propose a multi-level (turbine and farm level) strategy combining a mono-and a multi-turbine approach to create fault indicators insensitive to both operating and environmental conditions. At the turbine level, mono-turbine residuals (i.e. a difference between an actual monitored value and the predicted one) obtained with a normal behavior model expressing the causal relations between variables from the same single turbine and learnt during a normal condition period are calculated for each turbine, so as to get rid of the influence of the operating conditions. At the farm level, the residuals are then compared to a wind farm reference in a multi-turbine approach to obtain fault indicators insensitive to environmental conditions. Indicators for the objective performance evaluation are also proposed to compare wind turbine fault detection methods, which aim at evaluating the cost/benefit of the methods from a production manager's point of view. The performance of the proposed combined mono- and multi-turbine method is evaluated and compared to more classical methods proposed in the literature on a large real data set made of SCADA data recorded on a French wind farm during four years : it is shown than it can improve the fault detection performance when compared to a residual analysis limited at the turbine level only.

AB This paper proposes a reliability analysis method for the condition monitoring network of wind turbine blade based on wireless sensor networks. Two critical factors, which play significant roles in the reliability evaluation of the monitoring network, are focused on, that is, the reliability of sensor nodes and the reliability of communication links. First, with the established reliability models for sensor nodes and communication links, the method of establishing reliability simulation model of monitoring network is presented based on Monte Carlo method. Second, according to the analysis of the intra-cluster reliabilities of the tree topology and the mesh topology, the topology selection principle of the sensor network for a single blade is proposed. Finally, the influence of maintenance cycle and communication interference on the overall reliability of the monitoring network is illustrated and the proper maintenance cycle is achieved. The solution to communication interference is put forward with the data retransmission measure. The overall reliability of the network is improved effectively by adopting the one-time data retransmission measure. Our work is expected to provide the guidance in theory and technology for constructing the high-performance condition monitoring and control system for wind turbine blades.

AB Wind turbine performance and condition monitoring play vital roles in detecting and diagnosing suboptimal performance and guiding operations and maintenance. Here, a new seismic-based approach to monitoring the health of individual wind turbine components is presented. Transfer functions are developed linking key condition monitoring properties (drivetrain and tower acceleration) to unique, robust, and repeatable seismic signatures. Predictive models for extreme (greater than 99th percentile) drivetrain and tower acceleration based on independent seismic data exhibit higher skill than reference models based on hub-height wind speed. The seismic models detect extreme drivetrain and tower acceleration with proportions correct of 96% and 93%, hit rates of 91% and 82%, and low false alarm rates of 4% and 6%, respectively. Although new wind turbines incorporate many diagnostic sensors, seismic-based condition/performance monitoring may be particularly useful in extending the productive lifetime of previous generation wind turbines.

AB Dirt and mud on wind turbine blades (WTB) reduce productivity and can generate stops and downtimes. A condition monitoring system based on non-destructive tests by ultrasonic waves was used to analyse it. This paper employs an approach that considers advanced signal processing and machine learning to determine the thickness of the dirt and mud in a WTB. Firstly, the signal is filtered by Wavelet transform. FE and Feature Selection(FS) are employed to remove non-useful data and redundant features. FS selects the number of the most significant terms of the model for fault detection and identification, reducing the dimension of the dataset. Pattern recognition is carried out by the following supervised learning classifiers based on statistical models to calculate and classify the signal depending on the fault: Ensemble Subspace Discriminant; k-Nearest Neighbours; Linear Support Vector Machine; Linear Discriminant Analysis; Decision Trees. Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis is used to evaluate the classifiers. Neighbourhood Component Analysis has been employed in feature selection. Several case studies of mud on the WTB surface have been considered to test and validate the approach. Autoregressive (AR) model and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) have been employed to FE. The results provided by PCA show an improvement on the AR results. The novelty of this work is focused on applying this approach to detect and diagnose mud and dirt in WTB. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Effective condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of wind turbines are crucial for avoiding serious damages to wind turbines. The supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system of a wind turbine provides valuable insights into turbine performance. In order to make full use of such valuable information, this paper investigates fault diagnosis of wind turbines by using Gaussian process classifiers (GPC) to the operational data collected from the SCADA system. Both real-time and predictive fault diagnosis were considered. As an alternative to the support vector machine (SVM) technique, the GPC possesses the capability of providing probabilistic information about the fault types, which is valuable for making maintenance plan in real practice. The comparison results show that the GPC method is able to provide more accurate fault diagnosis results than the SVM technique on average. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Time-series data is widely adopted in condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of wind turbines as well as other energy systems, where long-term dependency is essential to form the classifiable features. To address the issues that the traditional approaches either rely on expert knowledge and handcrafted features or do not fully model long-term dependencies hidden in time-domain signals, this work presents a novel fault diagnosis framework based on an end-to-end Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model, to learn features directly from multivariate time-series data and capture long-term dependencies through recurrent behaviour and gates mechanism of LSTM. Experimental results on two wind turbine datasets show that our method is able to do fault classification effectively from raw time-series signals collected by single or multiple sensors and outperforms state-of-art approaches. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed framework is validated through the experiments on small dataset with limited data. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Reconstruction model is a powerful method for component condition monitoring and fault detection by considering the model prediction residuals. In this article, a new signal reconstruction modeling technique is proposed using support vector regression. Multiple indicators are calculated to recognize slight shift from normal condition, and detect the fault at an early stage. Input variables are selected based on correlation analysis and failure mode analysis. A sliding-time-window technique is employed to incorporate temporal information inherent in time-series data. Residuals between the observed signal and the reconstruction signal are utilized to indicate whether the desired quantity is different from its normal operation condition or not. Three statistical indicators (Deviation Index, Volatility Index and Significance Index) are defined to quantify the deviation level from normal condition to abnormal condition. Health index (HI) of a specific fault is derived from responsive statistical indicators, and the integral health index (integral-HI) of an entire component is composed of all individual health index. An experiment of real life wind turbine high temperature fault detection scheme is studied. Results show that the proposed approach demonstrates improved performance in detecting wind turbine faults, and controlling false and missed alarms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Condition-based maintenance is applied in various industries to monitor and control critical assets and to optimize maintenance efforts. Its applicability to the offshore wind energy industry has been considered for almost 20 years and has resulted in the development and implementation of solutions that have contributed to lower cost of maintenance and increased asset availability. However, there is currently no public domain guidance available that provides the information required to (i) prioritize systems for which condition monitoring would generate highest value and to (ii) understand the parameters that need to be monitored by a specific system from failure cause to failure mode. Both items are addressed in this paper, providing a clearly structured, risk-based assessment methodology and corresponding results for state-of-the-art offshore wind turbines. A total of 337 failure modes have been identified and analysed by experts representing approximately 70% of the European offshore wind market to assess potential benefits of condition monitoring systems. Results may be used to target the development of condition monitoring systems focusing on critical systems and to find optimal O&M strategies by understanding failure paths of main offshore wind turbine systems resulting in a lower cost of energy and a more optimal risk-return balance.

AB This work aims to propose a different approach to evaluate the operating conditions of a scaled wind turbine through vibration analysis. The turbine blades were built based on the NREL 5809 profile and a 40-cm diameter, while the design blade tip speed ratio (lambda) is equal to 7. Masses weighing 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g were added to the tip of one or two blades in a varying sequence with the intent of simulating potential problems and producing several scenarios from simple imbalances to severe rotor vibration levels to be compared to the control condition where the three blades and the system were balanced. The signals were processed and classified by a combination of detrended fluctuation analysis with Karhunen-Loeve Transform, Gaussian discriminator, and Artificial Neural Network, which are pattern recognition techniques with supervised learning. Good results were achieved by employing the above cited recognition techniques as more than 95% of normal and imbalanced cases were correctly classified. In a general way, it was also possible to identify different levels of blade imbalance, thus proving that the present approach may be an excellent predictive maintenance tool for vibration monitoring of wind turbines.

AB An effective way to save the costs for data storage and transmission in bearing fault diagnosis of wind turbines is to use a sparse representation of massive condition monitoring signals. A proper dictionary that is adaptive to the analyzed signal containing time-varying components is a key issue to improve the sparse level in the sparse representation method, which has not been addressed in the literature. This paper explores a new sparse representation method that uses a new time-varying cosine-packet dictionary for the bearing fault diagnosis of wind turbines operating under varying speed conditions. First, the time-varying shaft rotating frequency (SRF) of a wind turbine is estimated from a generator current signal recorded synchronously with the vibration signal. Then, the new dictionary is designed, in which the basic functions, called time-varying cosine packet, change with the SRF. Finally, a sparse coefficient spectrum (SCS) of the vibration envelope signal is constructed by the sparse coefficients of the signal projection on the new dictionary. The merits of the proposed sparse representation method are that the dictionary designed is adaptive to the variations of major frequencies of the vibration signals, and the nonzero sparse coefficients over the dictionary designed have a clear physical meaning, i.e., representing the amplitude weights of the major order components contained in the vibration envelope signals. Therefore, the possible bearing fault characteristic orders can be identified from the SCS of the vibration envelope signal. Laboratory and field test results show that the sparse coefficients obtained by the new sparse representation method are suitable for the representations of the bearing vibration signals and the SCS is effective for bearing fault diagnosis of direct-drive wind turbines.

ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; VIBRATION
AB Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are methods to achieve ahigher reliability for complex mechanical systems. Due to the ability of acoustic emission (AE) technology to detect damages during at an early stage, AE has high potential to be considered in novel machine condition monitoring systems. Since AE waves are generated due to rapid releases of strain energy, such as crack propagation, roughness contact and mechanical impacts, it is possible to use multiple AE sensors to track down the AE source location. This paper presents an accurate and easy-to-use methodology to locate AE sources in ring gears from planetary gearboxes. The methodology uses AE wave's time of arrival calculated from three signal differential envelopes. The time of arrival is subsequently used to analytically determine the angular position of the AE source. The proposed methodology was tested in two different real-sized wind turbine gearboxes using Hsu-Nielsen sources. The results showed that, with the correct selection of filter cut-off frequencies, the localization could be carried out with an error equivalent to only two teeth from the correct position, indicating the good performance of the approach.

TI Vibration-Based Condition Monitoring of Wind Turbine Gearboxes Based on
   Cyclostationary Analysis
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
LA English
DT Article
AB Wind industry experiences a tremendous growth during the last few decades. As of the end of 2016, the worldwide total installed electricity generation capacity from wind power amounted to 486,790 MW, presenting an increase of 12.5% compared to the previous year. Nowadays wind turbine manufacturers tend to adopt new business models proposing total health monitoring services and solutions, using regular inspections or even embedding sensors and health monitoring systems within each unit. Regularly planned or permanent monitoring ensures a continuous power generation and reduces maintenance costs, prompting specific actions when necessary. The core of wind turbine drivetrain is usually a complicated planetary gearbox. One of the main gearbox components which are commonly responsible for the machinery breakdowns are rolling element bearings. The failure signs of an early bearing damage are usually weak compared to other sources of excitation (e.g., gears). Focusing toward the accurate and early bearing fault detection, a plethora of signal processing methods have been proposed including spectral analysis, synchronous averaging and enveloping. Envelope analysis is based on the extraction of the envelope of the signal, after filtering around a frequency band excited by impacts due to the bearing faults. Kurtogram has been proposed and widely used as an automatic methodology for the selection of the filtering band, being on the other hand sensible in outliers. Recently, an emerging interest has been focused on modeling rotating machinery signals as cyclostationary, which is a particular class of nonstationary stochastic processes. Cyclic spectral correlation and cyclic spectral coherence (CSC) have been presented as powerful tools for condition monitoring of rolling element bearings, exploiting their cyclostationary behavior. In this work, a new diagnostic tool is introduced based on the integration of the cyclic spectral coherence (CSC) along a frequency band that contains the diagnostic information. A special procedure is proposed in order to automatically select the filtering band, maximizing the corresponding fault indicators. The effectiveness of the methodology is validated using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) wind turbine gearbox vibration condition monitoring benchmarking dataset which includes various faults with different levels of diagnostic complexity.

AB Wind turbines revolve in difficult operating conditions due to stochastic loads and produce massive vibration signals, which cause obstacles in detecting potential fault information. To overcome this, an adaptive fault detection approach is presented in this paper on the basis of parameterless empirical wavelet transform (PEWT) and the margin factor. PEWT can decompose the vibration signal into a series of empirical modes (EMs) through splitting its Fourier spectrum, using the scale space method and adaptively constructing an orthogonal wavelet filter bank. The margin factor is utilized as a key metric for automatically selecting the EM which is sensitive to the potential faults. The method presented in this paper will improve the efficiency and accuracy of fault information for the condition monitoring of wind turbines.

AB Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis for wind turbine gearbox is significant to save operation and maintenance costs. However, strong interferences from high-speed parallel gears and background noises make fault detection of wind turbine planetary gearbox challenging. This paper addresses the fault diagnosis for wind turbine planetary ring gear, which is intractable for traditional spectral analysis techniques, since the fault characteristic frequency of planetary ring gear can be resulted from the revolving planet gears inducing modulations even in healthy conditions. The main contribution is to establish an adaptive empirical wavelet transform framework for fault-related mode extraction, which incorporates a novel meshing frequency modulation phenomenon to enhance the planetary gear related vibration components in wind turbine gearbox. Moreover, an adaptive Fourier spectrum segmentation scheme using iterative backward-forward search algorithm is developed to achieve adaptive empirical wavelet transform for fault-related mode extraction. Finally, fault features are identified from envelope spectrums of the extracted modes. The simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework for fault diagnosis of wind turbine planetary ring gear. Comparative studies prove its superiority to reveal evident fault features and avoid the ambiguity from the planet carrier rotational frequency over ensemble empirical mode decomposition and spectral kurtosis.

AB It is well known that each year the wind sector has profit losses due to wind turbine failures and operation and maintenance costs. Therefore, operations related to these actions are crucial for wind farm operators and linked companies. One of the key points for failure prediction on wind turbine using SCADA data is to select the optimal or near optimal set of inputs that can feed the failure prediction (prognosis) algorithm. Due to a high number of possible predictors (from tens to hundreds), the optimal set of inputs obtained by exhaustive-search algorithms is not viable in the majority of cases. In order to tackle this issue, show the viability of prognosis and select the best set of variables from more than 200 analogous variables recorded at intervals of 5 or 10 min by the wind farm's SCADA, in this paper a thorough study of automatic input selection algorithms for wind turbine failure prediction is presented and an exhaustive-search-based quasi-optimal (QO) algorithm, which has been used as a reference, is proposed. In order to evaluate the performance, a k-NN classification algorithm is used. Results showed that the best automatic feature selection method in our case-study is the conditional mutual information (CMI), while the worst one is the mutual information feature selection (MIFS). Furthermore, the effect of the number of neighbours (k) is tested. Experiments demonstrate that k = 1 is the best option if the number of features is higher than 3. The experiments carried out in this work have been extracted from measures taken along an entire year and corresponding to gearbox and transmission systems of Fuhrlander wind turbines.

AB Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and Condition Monitoring (CM) Systems are currently utilised to collect data from offshore wind turbines (OWTs), to enhance the accurate estimation of their operational performance. However, industry accepted practices for effectively managing the information that these systems provide have not been widely established yet. This paper presents a four-step methodological framework for the effective data management of SHM systems of OWTs and illustrates its applicability in real-time continuous data collected from three operational units, with the aim of utilising more complete and accurate datasets for fatigue life assessment of support structures. Firstly, a time-efficient synchronisation method that enables the continuous monitoring of these systems is presented, followed by a novel approach to noise cleansing and the posterior missing data imputation (MDI). By the implementation of these techniques those data-points containing excessive noise are removed from the dataset (Step 2), advanced numerical tools are employed to regenerate missing data (Step 3) and fatigue is estimated for the results of these two methodologies (Step 4). Results show that after cleansing, missing data can be imputed with an average absolute error of 2.1%, while this error is kept within the [+ 15.2% - 11.0%] range in 95% of cases. Furthermore, only 0.15% of the imputed data fell outside the noise thresholds. Fatigue is found to be underestimated both, when data cleansing does not take place and when it takes place but MDI does not. This makes this novel methodology an enhancement to conventional structural integrity assessment techniques that do not employ continuous datasets in their analyses.

AB A power curve conventionally represents the relationship between hub height wind speed and wind turbine power output. Power curves facilitate the prediction of power production at a site and are also useful in identifying the significant changes in turbine performance which can be vital for condition monitoring. However, their accuracy is significantly influenced by changes in air density, mainly when the turbine is operating below rated power. A Gaussian process (GP) is a nonparametric machine learning approach useful for power curve fitting. Critical analysis of temperature correction is essential for improving the accuracy of wind turbine power curves. The conventional approach is to correct the data for air density before it is binned to provide a power curve, as described in the IEC standard. In this paper, four different possible approaches of air density correction and its effect on GP power curve fitting model accuracy are explored to identify whether the traditional IEC approach used for air density correction is most effective when estimating power curves using a GP. Finding the most accurate air density compensation approach is necessary to minimize GP model uncertainty.

AB As a clean non-pollution and renewable energy producer, the healthy running of wind turbines can directly influence the electric power output of the wind farm. In order to maintain the safety running of the wind turbines, intelligent fault diagnosis and healthy condition monitoring techniques have been introduced to decrease the running costs and to improve the maintenance management. In this study, a multi-dimensional kernel domain spectrum (MD-KDS) method is proposed to solve the problem. The kernel domain spectrum (KDS) of known categories data are established based on the bispectrum and threshold processing. Then the distance and probability are calculated in the MDKDS recognizer. The minimum discrimination function value outputted from the MDKDS recognizer can reflect the data fault types to be recognized. The real wind turbine monitoring data experiment proved the availability and accuracy of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Feature extraction from vibration signals is considerably significant for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. The Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) technique essentially transforming a real-valued time series into a symbol sequence, has been proven as a potential tool of feature extraction for machinery intelligent diagnosis. However, challenge still exists that the SAX cannot fulfill feature extraction tasks well since it is carried out only on the basis of mean value in time domain. To overcome this limitation, an improved SAX (ISAX) is proposed in this paper. This new method substitutes the feature of mean value in time domain with multiple features extracted from time, frequency and time-frequency domains in order to obtain comprehensive fault information. With the ISAX transformation, a vibration signal can be transformed into various symbol sequences according to the multi-domain features. Next the Shannon entropy technique is conducted on a symbol sequence to capture sequential patterns in local signals and then the Shannon entropy value is used as the eigenvalue of the symbol sequence. Various eigenvalues are obtained to describe a vibration signal from different perspectives, which leads to a better feature extraction. These eigenvalues are then fed into the Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) to reduce dimensions and extract principal features for classification tasks. Compared with SAX, the most significant advantage of ISAX is extracting comprehensive signal characteristics from multi-domain. Moreover, the ISAX captures fault information better considering the local fault patterns. The effectiveness and superiority of ISAX were validated by experimental studies using the fault signals of rolling bearings and reciprocating compressor valves with remarkably high classification rates.

AB In MW-sized wind turbines, the most widely-used generator is the wound rotor induction machine, with a partially-rated voltage source converter connected to the rotor. This generator is a significant cause of wind turbine fault modes. In this paper, a harmonic time-stepped generator model is applied to derive wound rotor induction generator electrical & mechanical signals for fault measurement, and propose simple closed-form analytical expressions to describe them. Predictions are then validated with tests on a 30 kW induction generator test rig. Results show that generator rotor unbalance produces substantial increases in the side-bands of supply frequency and slotting harmonic frequencies in the spectra of current, power, speed, mechanical torque and vibration measurements. It is believed that this is the first occasion in which such comprehensive approach has been presented for this type of machine, with healthy & faulty conditions at varying loads and rotor faults. Clear recommendations of the relative merits of various electrical & mechanical signals for detecting rotor faults are given, and reliable fault indicators are identified for incorporation into wind turbine condition monitoring systems. Finally, the paper proposes that fault detectability and reliability could be improved by data fusion of some of these electrical & mechanical signals. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Intensive condition monitoring of wind generation plant through analysis of routinely collected SCADA data is seen as a viable means of forestalling costly plant failure and optimising maintenance through identification of failure at the earliest possible stage. The challenge to operators is in identifying the signatures of failure within data streams and disambiguating these from other operational factors. The well understood power curve representation of turbine performance offers an intuitive and quantitative means of identifying abnormal operation, but only if noise and artefacts of operating regime change can be excluded. In this paper, a methodology for wind turbine performance monitoring based on the use of high-frequency SCADA data is employed featuring state-of-the-art multivariate non-parametric methods for power curve modelling. The model selection considerations for these are examined together with their sensitivity to several factors, including site specific conditions, seasonality effects, input relevance and data sampling rate. The results, based on operational data from four wind farms, are discussed in a practical context with the use of high frequency data demonstrated to be beneficial for performance monitoring purposes whereas further attention is required in the area of expressing model uncertainty.

AB The wind energy industry has developed very fast, while the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis for wind turbine is increasingly becoming the focus of manufacturers and wind-farm operators. However, due to the influence of harsh operation environment and complex internal structure of wind turbine, collected vibration signals are corrupted by strong noise. Effective extraction of useful feature information submerged in strong noise that is indicative of structural defects has remained a major challenge. In this paper, a novel frequency-shift multiscale noise tuning stochastic resonance (SR) method is proposed with the advantage of SR using noise to enhance weak signal features. Firstly, the frequency shift modulation algorithm is adopted to move the target signal to the designated low frequency domain. Then the obtained modulated signal is processed by the multiscale noise tuning algorithm based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The resulting output is used as the input of SR system. Finally, the tuning parameter of multiscale noise is determined by maximizing the modified signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of system output. The proposed method can realize the feature enhancement and extraction of weak signal with arbitrary frequency. Experiments and fault diagnosis case of generator bearing in wind turbine validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wind energy conversion system technology has attracted worldwide attention, and the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis for the system become significant issues. A data-driven fault diagnosis method is presented to detect and locate open-circuit switch faults of the back-to-back converter in permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)-based wind generation system. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based neural network is applied as a fault diagnosis method, and the dropout process is employed to deal with the over-fitting problem. Twelve sensor signals of current and voltage in the back-to-back converter in various conditions are measured. A grid-connected PMSG-based wind generation model has been built in MATLAB/Simulink to estimate the proposed algorithm. Least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) and back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) are applied as comparison methods. Simulation results reveals that the proposed theory has a decent performance regarding the detection and location of different faulty switches in an assembly of various operating conditions.

   turbine reliability; Temperature estimation
AB The majority of electrical failures in wind turbines occur in the semiconductor components (IGBTs) of converters. To increase reliability and decrease the maintenance costs associated with this component, several health-monitoring methods have been proposed in the literature. Many laboratory-based tests have been conducted to detect the failure mechanisms of the IGBT in their early stages through monitoring the variations of thermo-sensitive electrical parameters. The methods are generally proposed and validated with a single-phase converter with an air-cored inductive or resistive load. However, limited work has been carried out considering limitations associated with measurement and processing of these parameters in a three-phase converter. Furthermore, looking at just variations of the module junction temperature will most likely lead to unreliable health monitoring as different failure mechanisms have their own individual effects on temperature variations of some, or all, of the electrical parameters. A reliable health monitoring system is necessary to determine whether the temperature variations are due to the presence of a premature failure or from normal converter operation. To address this issue, a temperature measurement approach should be independent from the failure mechanisms. In this paper, temperature is estimated by monitoring an electrical parameter particularly affected by different failure types. Early bond wire lift-off is detected by another electrical parameter that is sensitive to the progress of the failure. Considering two separate electrical parameters, one for estimation of temperature (switching off time) and another to detect the premature bond wire lift-off (collector emitter on-state voltage) enhance the reliability of an IGBT could increase the accuracy of the temperature estimation as well as premature failure detection.

AB A novel stator current-based failure diagnostic technique for the rotor winding inter-turn short-circuit fault in Doubly Fed Induction Generators(DFIG) is performed in this paper. The object of the online fault diagnosis is to enhance the condition monitoring, performance and reduce the downtime and maintenance costs of the wind turbine. To accomplish this purpose, an efficient algorithm founded on the combination of the Time-Synchronous-Averaging (TSA) technique and Power Spectral Density (PSD) method is constructed. The new proposed algorithm has been implemented applying simulations established in the MatLab (R) SIMULINK. Diverse scenarios of simulation have been built for a healthy functioning and a defective case at three levels of rotor defect. The obtained results demonstrate the potency and effectiveness of the proposed method for rotor inter-turn short circuit defect diagnosis.

TI Automated Fault Detection of Wind Turbine Gearbox using Data-Driven
   Approach

AB Wind turbine manufacturers have adopted condition monitoring systems to monitor and report a turbine's health and operating parameters to ensure that the system operates within its design specifications. While the present systems use specialized condition monitoring hardware to detect abnormal acoustic or vibration signals, it is not capable of pinpointing the exact location of the fault apart from isolating the system from which the signal originated. This drawback can be attributed to the requirement of powerful signal processors in order to decode the signal and efforts to train a system to identify the signal emitted by a faulty component. In the light of recent advancement of data-driven approaches and signal processing, these drawbacks can be overcome with increased computation power and sophisticated algorithms that foray into every integrated system. This paper reports such an investigation conducted on a miniature wind turbine planetary gearbox subjected to multi-component failures. The vibration signals were acquired using two accelerometers placed inside the gearbox. The speed of the gearbox was varied according to a simulated wind flow pattern. The primary goal of the study was to investigate the practicality of implementing data-driven approaches to categorise multi-component faults from a composite non-stationary signal. Short time Fourier transforms (STFT) coefficients were used as attributes by a set of data-driven algorithms to build machine learning models. Each model built was tested with a randomised set of instances which was reserved from the main dataset and tested multiple times by means of cross validation. The novelty in the paper entails a methodology which has been devised to classify faults using a randomised vibration dataset with little human intervention by means of machine learning algorithms. The authors propose that this methodology can also be used for real-time fault detection and classification for various machinery and components.

AB A model-based condition monitoring has been established to assess the degradation of IGBT modules in wind turbines due to power cycling (thermo-mechanical degradation) and humidity (electrochemical degradation). For the estimation of the over-all lifetime of the IGBT modules, the model extracts the power losses from the converter currents and voltages and calculates the semiconductors' junction temperature based on a Cauer-model. A similar approach is applied for the calculation of the microclimate at the chip surface based on the outside humidity and operation conditions. To parametrise the degradation models, accelerated power cycling and temperature humidity tests were performed in the laboratory.
   Fed with operational and environmental data, the overall model can provide the health status of the devices and this can be done even in real-time, if implemented into the converter controller. To test the system, data from an active wind farm was gathered by several data acquisition systems. The field data covers all seasons and various weather conditions. However, the calculated useful lifetimes were well beyond 100 years even for worst-case scenarios and, thus, the investigated wind turbines should not fail within their projected lifetime. Neither the degradation due to power cycling nor the degradation due to humidity driven effects nor special events like lightning strikes should become lifetime limiting. Either the failure mechanisms investigated are not the predominant ones or the power semiconductor devices are not the primary failure. In fact, the same power semiconductors survive the much harsher operating conditions in traction applications and, thus, the wind converters investigated seem to be significantly overdesigned for their operation conditions. Nevertheless, there are indeed failures that a suspected to be humidity related and, thus, require more attention.

ID EXTENDED KALMAN FILTER; OBSERVERS
AB Vibration signals are widely used in wind turbine drivetrain condition monitoring with the aim of fault detection, optimization of maintenance actions and therefore reduction of operating costs. Signals are most commonly sampled by accelerometers at high frequency for a few seconds. The behavior of these signals varies significantly, even within the same turbine and depends on different parameters. The aim of this paper is to explore the effect of operational and environmental conditions on the vibration signals of wind turbine gearboxes. Parameters such as speed, power and yaw angle are taken into account and the change in vibration signals is examined. The study includes examples from real wind turbines of both normal operation and operation with known gearbox faults. The effects of varying operating conditions are removed using kalman filtering as a state observer. The findings of this paper will aid in understanding wind turbine gearbox vibration signals, making more informed decisions in the presence of faults and improving maintenance decisions.

AB This work describes an automated condition monitoring framework to process and analyze vibration data measured on wind turbine gearboxes. The current state-of-the-art in signal processing often leads to a large quantity in health indicators thanks to the multiple potential pre-processing steps. Such large quantities of indicators become unfeasible to inspect manually when the data volume and the number of monitored turbines increases. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid analysis approach that combines advanced signal processing methods with machine learning and anomaly detection. This approach is investigated on an experimental wind turbine gearbox vibration data set. It is found that the combination of physics -based statistical indicators with machine learning is capable of detecting planetary gear stage damage and significantly simplifying the data analysis and inspection in the process.

TI Impact of Load Ramping on Power Transformer Dissolved Gas Analysis
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Dissolved gas analysis; insulation oil; load ramping; power transformer
ID TEMPERATURE; ADDITIVES; FAULTS
AB Dissolved gas in oil analysis (DGA) is one of the most reliable condition monitoring techniques, which is currently used by the industry to detect incipient faults within the power transformers. While the technique is well matured since the development of various offline and online measurement techniques along with various interpretation methods, no much attention was given so far to the oil sampling time and its correlation with the transformer loading. A power transformer loading is subject to continuous daily and seasonal variations, which is expected to increase with the increased penetration level of renewable energy sources of intermittent characteristics, such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy into the current electricity grids. Generating unit transformers also undergoes similar loading variations to follow the demand, particularly in the new electricity market. As such, the insulation system within the power transformers is expected to exhibit operating temperature variations due to the continuous ramping up and down of the generation and load. If the oil is sampled for the DGA measurement during such ramping cycles, results will not be accurate, and a fault may be reported due to a gas evolution resulting from such temporarily loading variation. This paper is aimed at correlating the generation and load ramping with the DGA measurements through extensive experimental analyses. The results reveal a strong correlation between the sampling time and the generation/load ramping. The experimental results show the effect of load variations on the gas generation and demonstrate the vulnerabilities of misinterpretation of transformer faults resulting from temporary gas evolution. To achieve accurate DGA, transformer loading profile during oil sampling for the DGA measurement should be available. Based on the initial investigation in this paper, the more accurate DGA results can be achieved after a ramping down cycle of the load. This sampling time could be defined as an optimum oil sampling time for transformer DGA.

DE Wind turbine fault classification; Generative adversarial network (GAN);
   Temporal convolutional neural network (TCNN); Deep learning; Condition
   monitoring
AB Condition monitoring of wind turbines (WTs) has attracted a great deal of attention due to fast development of WTs. The inherent intermittence of wind energy and locating WTs in remote areas, makes designing proper fault diagnosing method difficult. To address this issue, we have proposed a two-block deep learning based method in this paper, which encapsulates two feature extraction and classification stages in an end-to-end architecture. In the designed method, we have utilized generative adversarial network (GAN) as feature extraction block and temporal convolutional neural network (TCNN) as fault classifier block. The proposed structure benefits from the leverage GAN and TCNN. The simulation results based on real-data from a 3 MGW WT in Ireland, which is obtained from supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) demonstrates that it is a suitable alternative for WTs' fault classification. To show the superiority of the proposed method, the results are compared with support vector machine (SVM) and feed-forward neural network (FFNN).

AB This article deals with the monitoring of mechanical defects in wind turbine transmissions. The presented algorithms make possible to extract a particular harmonic relating to a defect in different speed conditions (fixed speed and variable speed). The method used here is performed without mechanical sensor. An observer is used to estimate the rotation speed measured from voltages and currents. This observer ensures amplification of the defect. Then, a Kalman Filter estimator coupled with a modified Sliding Window Empirical Mode Decomposition (SWEMD) extraction allows to extract the harmonic corresponding to the defect and follow it in real time. The results are provided in the case of a wind turbine installation.

AB Digitally enhanced services for wind power could reduce Operations and Maintenance (O&M) costs as well as the Levelised Cost Of Energy (LCOE). Therefore, there is a continuous need for advanced monitoring techniques which can exploit the opportunities of Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data Analytics, revolutionizing the future of the energy sector. The heart of wind turbines is a rather complex epicyclic gearbox. Among others, extremely critical gearbox components which are often responsible for machinery stops are the rolling element bearings. The vibration signatures of bearings are rather weak compared to other components, such as gears, and as a result an extended number of signal processing techniques and tools have been proposed during the last decades, focusing towards accurate, early, and on time bearing fault detection with limited false alarms and missed detections. Envelope Analysis is one of the most important methodologies, where an envelope of the vibration signal is estimated usually after filtering around a frequency band excited by impacts due to the bearing faults. Different tools, such as Kurtogram, have been proposed in order to accurately select the optimum filter parameters (center frequency and bandwidth). Cyclic Spectral Correlation and Cyclic Spectral Coherence, based on Cyclostationary Analysis, have been proved as very powerful tools for condition monitoring. The monitoring techniques seem to have reached a mature level in case a machinery operates under steady speed and load. On the other hand, in case the operating conditions change, it is still unclear whether the change of the monitoring indicators is due to the change of the health of the machinery or due to the change of the operating parameters. Recently, the authors have proposed a new tool called IESFOgram, which is based on Cyclic Spectral Coherence and can automatically select the filtering band. Furthermore, the Cyclic. Spectral Coherence is integrated along the selected frequency band leading to an Improved Envelope Spectrum. In this paper, the performance of the tool is evaluated and further extended on cases operating under different speeds and different loads. The effectiveness of the methodology is tested and validated on the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) wind turbine gearbox vibration condition monitoring benchmarking data set which includes various faults with different levels of diagnostic complexity as well as various speed and load operating conditions.

AB The article proposes H-infinity Kalman Filtering for condition monitoring of a wind-power generation system comprising a two-mass drivetrain and a DFIG. The H-infinity Kalman Filter is a robust state estimator which represents the fault-free functioning of the wind-power generation system. However, this filter is primarily designed for linear systems and to enable its use in the case of the nonlinear dynamics of the wind-turbine and DFIG, the state-space model of this power system undergoes first approximate linearization through Taylor series expansion and the computation of Jacobian matrices. By subtracting the outputs estimates provided by the H-infinity Kalman Filter from the real outputs of the power unit the residuals' sequence is generated. It is shown that the square of the sum of the residuals' vector, weighted by the inverse of the associated covariance matrix, forms a stochastic variable which follows the x2-distribution. Next, by using the properties of the aforementioned distribution, confidence intervals are defined which allow for concluding with a high certainty if the monitored power system has undergone a failure or if it has been subject to a cyberattack. Actually, as long as the previously noted stochastic variable falls within the bounds of the confidence interval it is concluded that the functioning of the wind-power unit remains normal. Otherwise, when the bounds of the confidence interval are exceeded the existence of a fault or cyberattack can be detected. Finally, by applying the statistical test into subspaces of the wind-power unit's state-space description, fault or cyberattack isolation can be achieved.

AB Offshore wind assets have reached multi-GW scale and additional capacity is being installed and developed. To achieve demanding cost of energy targets, awarded by competitive auctions, the operation and maintenance (O&M) of these assets has to become increasingly efficient, whilst ensuring compliance and effectiveness. Existing offshore wind farm assets generate a significant amount of inhomogeneous data related to O&M processes. These data contain rich information about the condition of the assets, which is rarely fully utilized by the operators and service providers. Academic and industrial research and development efforts have led to a suite of tools trying to apply sensor data and build machine learning models to diagnose, trend and predict component failures. This study presents a decision support framework incorporating a range of different supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. The aim is to provide guidance for asset owners on how to select the most relevant datasets, apply and choose the different machine learning algorithms and how to integrate the data stream with daily maintenance procedures. The presented methodology is tested on a real case example of an offshore wind turbine gearbox replacement at Teesside offshore wind farm. The study uses k-nearest neighbour (kNN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms to detect the fault using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data and an autoregressive model for the vibration data of the condition monitoring system (CMS). The implementation of all the algorithms has resulted in an accuracy higher than 94%. The results of this paper will be of interest to offshore wind farm developers and operators to streamline and optimize their O&M planning activities for their assets and reduce the associated costs.

AB The base-plate solder fatigue of the IGBT module is one of the failures of the wind power converter; however, the existing health condition monitoring method based on infrared thermography is difficult to be applied to the actual applications. In this paper, a health condition assessment method of the base-plate solder fatigue for the IGBT module is introduced based on the case temperature difference. First, according to the structure of the IGBT module, a 3D finite element model is established, and the junction and case temperatures at different delamination degrees are investigated. Second, for defining the degradation degree, identifying the steady-state process, and acquiring the case temperature, an assessment method of the base-plate solder fatigue based on the case temperature difference is established. Finally, taking the experiment of a practical wind turbine converter IGBT module as an example, the assessment process of base-plate solder of the IGBT module is demonstrated, and the results show that the proposed assessment method is correct and effective.

ID RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS; DESIGN
AB Wind energy is an important renewable energy source. Reduction of the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for wind turbines are very important in order to make wind energy competitive compared to other energy sources, especially for offshore wind turbines. All costs in the life-cycle as well as the energy produced contribute to the calculation of LCOE. Therefore the turbine components should be designed to have sufficient reliability but also not be too costly, and it is important to include in the reliability assessment the information obtained during operation (from condition monitoring and inspections) and the maintenance performed (incl. repairs and replacements). The paper presents models for reliability-and risk-optimal planning of Operation & maintenance incl. inspections.

ID FAULT-DETECTION; DIAGNOSIS
AB Wind turbines condition monitoring and fault warning have important practical value for wind farms to reduce maintenance costs and improve operation levels. Due to the increase in the number of wind farms and turbines, the amount of data of wind turbines have increased dramatically. This problem has caused a need for efficiency and accuracy in monitoring the operating condition of the turbine. In this paper, the idea of deep learning is introduced into wind turbine condition monitoring. After selecting the variables by the method of the adaptive elastic network, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long and short term memory network (LSTM) are combined to establish the logical relationship between observed variables. Based on training data and hardware facilities, the method is used to process the temperature data of gearbox bearing. The purpose of artificial intelligence monitoring and over-temperature fault warning of the high-speed side of bearing is realized efficiently and conveniently. The example analysis experiments verify the high practicability and generalization of the proposed method.

AB Condition monitoring (CM) is widely used in wind turbines (WTs) to reduce operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. Bearings are crucial components in WT and many bearing CM approaches have focused on vibration analysis. Statistical theory and artificial intelligence-based WT bearings evaluation methods require mass data for training, which makes the detection of incipient failures barely possible. In this paper, a WT bearing performance evaluation method is proposed based on the similarity analysis of fuzzy k-principal curves (FKPCs) in manifold space. For a start, 38 features are extracted from bearing vibration signals to constitute high-dimensional feature matrices. The feature matrices for the healthy samples and the samples to be evaluated are then transformed into 3-D space. Afterward, the FKPCs are extracted and the similarities among the curves of samples are calculated based on the Hausdorff distance to evaluate the performance of the bearing. Bearing degradation experiments are investigated to verify the efficiency of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed FKPC method can portray the degradation trend of bearings accurately with the capability of detecting incipient failures. The proposed method can be applied in the case of small-size training samples with stable performance.

ID SPEED ESTIMATION
AB Having access to certain variables, which are normally not measured, could be beneficial to maintenance, condition monitoring, and control of wind turbines and farms. However, incorporating additional sensors to measure such variables could increase the overall cost significantly. It is therefore proposed in this feasibility study that only one turbine in a wind cluster of several turbines be equipped with a sensor and each of the remaining turbines with an estimator, instead of equipping each turbine with an expensive sensor. Each nonlinear estimator is constructed based on neural network (NN), and the only turbine equipped with a sensor is used to train the NN-based estimator, applied to each of the remaining turbines. On the other hand, it is much more complicated and expensive to estimate the wind speed that the turbine experiences using the same approach as it would require at least one expensive light detection and ranging system as a sensor (and for training the NN-based estimator) within a cluster. However, estimating the wind speed could improve maintenance, condition monitoring, and control of wind turbines and farms in many ways. In the second part of the paper, an extended Kalman filter (EKF), instead of NN is therefore constructed to estimate the wind speed. Although the EKF could be used for different purposes, it is exploited here to improve the NN-based estimator from the first part of this paper. The simulation results are presented demonstrating that 1) the NN-based estimator could estimate important variables successfully, 2) the EKF could estimate the wind speed, and 3) the NN-based estimator could be refined or further improved by exploiting the wind speed estimated by the EKF.

AB While wind turbine (WT) power capacities continue to increase and new offshore developments are being deployed, operation and maintenance (O&M) costs continue to rise, becoming the center of attention in the wind energy sector. The electric generator is among the top three contributors to failure rates and downtime of WTs, where the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is the dominant technology among variable speed WTs. Thus, the early detection of generator faults, which can be achieved through predictive maintenance, is vital in order to reduce O&M costs. The goal of this paper is to analyze a long-term monitoring campaign of an in-service WT equipped with a DFIG. A novel method named the harmonic order tracking analysis is used with two main objectives: first, to facilitate the data interpretation for non-trained maintenance personnel, and second, to reduce the amount of data that must be stored and transferred for the diagnosis of the DFIG. This method is applied and validated for the first time on an operating WT.

AB This paper presents an experimental verification of the statistical time-series methods, which utilize adapted frequency response ratio (FRR), autoregressive (AR) model parameter and AR model residual as performance characteristics, for diagnosing the damage of wind turbine blades. Specifically, the statistical decision-making techniques are used to identify the status patterns from turbine vibration data. For experiments, a small-size, laboratory-used operating wind turbine structure is used. The performance of each method in diagnosing damages simulated by saw cut in three critical positions in the blade are assessed and compared. The experimental results show that these methods yielded a promising damage diagnosis capability in the condition monitoring of wind turbine.

AB Condition monitoring, nondestructive testing, and fault diagnosis are currently considered crucial processes for on-condition maintenance (OCM) to increase the reliability and availability of wind turbines and reduce the wind energy generation cost. Carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRPs) have been increasingly used to fabricate wind turbine blades. Delamination-type damage is inevitable during manufacture or in-service of a CFRP blade. This inner (subsurface) flaw, usually difficult to be detected by artificial visual inspection or machine vision based on CCD or CMOS, severely degrades the load-bearing capacity of a blade. Induction infrared thermography (IIT) is an emerging infrared machine vision inspection technology, which has the capability of insight to CFRP based on electromagnetic induction and heat conduction. This paper introduces photothermal thermal-wave radar (TWR) nondestructive imaging (NDI) to IIT, based on cross-correlation (CC) pulse compression and matched filtering and applies TWR principles to CFRP imaging inspection and diagnosis. The experimental studies carried out under the transmission mode have shown that TWR B-scan and phasegram can be used to inspect and diagnose subsurface delaminations in CFRP with improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and shape identification. As a new machine vision inspection method, TWRI will play an important role in the OCM of the wind turbine blade.

ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS
AB A sample of healthy wind turbines from the same wind farm with identical sizes and designs was investigated to determine the average vibrational signatures of the drive train components during normal operation. The units were variable-speed machines with three blades. The rotor was supported by two bearings, and the drive train connected to an intermediate three-stage planetary/helical gearbox. The nominal 2 MW output power was regulated using blade pitch adjustment. Vibrations were measured in exactly the same positions using the same type of sensors over a six-month period covering the entire range of operating conditions. The data set was preliminary validated to remove outliers based on the theoretical power curves. The most relevant frequency peaks in the rotor, gearbox, and generator vibrations were detected and identified based on averaged power spectra. The amplitudes of the peaks induced by a common source of excitation were compared in different measurement positions. A wind speed dependency of broadband vibration amplitudes was also observed. Finally, a fault detection case is presented showing the change of vibration signature induced by a damage in the gearbox.

AB Condition monitoring of Wind Turbine based induction generators still faces challenges due to their operation in harsh and aggressive environments. The detection of anomalies at an initial stage is necessary for reducing the downtime of Wind Turbines. Depending on wind speed, the wind turbine generator operates continuously in non-stationary conditions. Under non-stationary conditions, the rotor fault frequency components present at generator output spreads out on bandwidth proportional to the speed which complicates its detectability. Therefore, this paper proposes a potential approach based on the use of wavelet analysis for diagnosing rotor eccentricity fault using WTG electrical signals. Its effectiveness under speed and load varying conditions is validated by experiments on a wind turbine condition monitoring test rig. The effectiveness of the setup was benchmarked with already proven WT test rigs. (C) 2017 Ain Shams University.

AB To detect wind turbine faults at an early stage, an investigation into a practical maintenance and repair approach was carried out on Jeju Island, South Korea. A condition monitoring system was installed in each wind turbine nacelle to detect the vibration signals from the gearbox and the generator. The vibration signals were measured by strain gauges on the gearbox and the generator for a period of approximately one to two years. A time domain analysis to detect the components' faults was performed, and a frequency domain analysis was conducted to find the location of the faults that occurred. Using the criteria of acceptance level for the root mean square suggested in Verein Deutscher Ingenieure standard 3834, it was determined whether or not the gearbox and the generator were operated normally. After a fault was detected by root mean square analysis, the fast fourier transform spectrum was analyzed and then compared with that suggested by the International Organization for Standardization standard 10816-21 and 13373-1. Repair work was then conducted on the defective parts of the components. The root mean square and the acceleration value of the normal, the warning and the abnormal conditions were compared with one another. As a result, cavitation might occur in the gear oil pump attached to the gearbox due to the high acceleration values observed for frequencies ranging from 5000 Hz to 11000 Hz. Additionally, the generator bearing at the non drive end was found to be broken because the defect frequency of the bearing was 88 Hz, which was derived from envelope spectrum analysis. The root mean square and the acceleration values for the gearbox and the generator decreased to values indicating normal operating conditions after the damage repair. The annual energy production increased by 1.8 % after the generator bearing repair.

AB As wind energy is experiencing an unprecedented development in today's world, the condition monitoring of wind turbine systems which can avoid serious accidents and economic losses are gathering more and more attentions. Considering the evaluation methods based on machine learning are complicated and unstable in terms of model training and parameter selection, this paper proposed a novel assessment algorithm based on similarity analysis of fuzzy k-principal curves (FKPCs) in manifold space. Initially, 38 fusion features containing time-domain, frequency-domain, and wavelet node energy features are extracted from the vibration signal of the wind turbine bearing. Then, the nonlinear local algorithm Laplacian eigenmaps was introduced to transform the original features to the projected lower dimensional space and obtain the more typical parameters. Combining fuzzy clustering with the k-principal curve creatively, smooth principal curves of the feature sets were then extracted according to point distribution in three-dimensional manifold space. Finally, the Hausdorff distance algorithm was employed to calculate the similarity between the principal curves of healthy and test datasets to assess the running condition of wind turbine. To validate the present method, the experiments of accelerated bearing degradation were carried out. A series of comprehensive and persuasive comparisons and analysis with different feature conversion methods (principal component analysis [PCA] and Isomap), different distance analysis algorithms (Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance), and different assessment models (hidden Markov model [HMM] and deep belief network [DBN]) verified that the proposed FKPC technique can monitor the operating status of the machine more accurately without complex model training and parameter selection processes.

AB Wind farms consist in many midsize generating units. The height of equipments, their placement and the ongoing tendency to put them offshore require monitoring at distance. The technology to convert wind energy with permanent magnet generators is widely used in wind energy systems, despite the fact that this electric machine is one of most recent generators on the market. The goal of this paper is the proposal and the experimental validation of voltage and current signatures to detect incipient faults on PMSG (Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator). The three faults discussed in this paper are the stator turn-to-turn fault, the permanent magnet demagnetization and the rotor eccentricity. The short circuit fault between turns was determined by analyzing the signature of the third harmonic voltage and its multiples. The proposed methodology is able to detect the faulty phase despite the presence of a third harmonic caused by machine asymmetries and asymmetric loads. The use of multiples of the third harmonic is essential for that. Regarding the permanent magnet demagnetization, the detection was made by measuring the voltage waveform of a stator derivation coil. The current signature method proposed can detect the static eccentricity, even in the prototype that has low inductance and large air gap, typical characteristics of midsize generating units for wind farms.

AB Due to the increasing installation of wind turbines in remote locations, both onshore and offshore, advanced fault detection and classification strategies have become crucial to accomplish the required levels of reliability and availability. In this work, without using specific tailored devices for condition monitoring but only increasing the sampling frequency in the already available (in all commercial wind turbines) sensors of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, a data-driven multi-fault detection and classification strategy is developed. An advanced wind turbine benchmark is used. The wind turbine we consider is subject to different types of faults on actuators and sensors. The main challenges of the wind turbine fault detection lie in their non-linearity, unknown disturbances, and significant measurement noise at each sensor. First, the SCADA measurements are pre-processed by group scaling and feature transformation (from the original high-dimensional feature space to a new space with reduced dimensionality) based on multiway principal component analysis through sample-wise unfolding. Then, 10-fold cross-validation support vector machines-based classification is applied. In this work, support vector machines were used as a first choice for fault detection as they have proven their robustness for some particular faults, but at the same time have never accomplished the detection and classification of all the proposed faults considered in this work. To this end, the choice of the features as well as the selection of data are of primary importance. Simulation results showed that all studied faults were detected and classified with an overall accuracy of 98.2%. Finally, it is noteworthy that the prediction speed allows this strategy to be deployed for online (real-time) condition monitoring in wind turbines.

AB When constructed on tall building rooftops, the vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) has the potential of power generation in highly urbanized areas. In this paper, the ambient dynamic responses of a rooftop VAWT were investigated. The dynamic analysis was based on ambient measurements of the structural vibration of the VAWT (including the supporting structure), which resides on the top of a 24-story building. To help process the ambient vibration data, an automated algorithm based on stochastic subspace identification (SSI) with a fast clustering procedure was developed. The algorithm was applied to the vibration data for mode identification, and the results indicate interesting modal responses that may be affected by the building vibration, which have significant implications for the condition monitoring strategy for the VAWT. The environmental effects on the ambient vibration data were also investigated. It was found that the blade rotation speed contributes the most to the vibration responses.

AB The vast installment of wind turbines and the development of condition monitoring system provides large amounts of operational data for condition monitoring and health management, while the lack of labeled data becomes one of the major challenges for the data analytics. To address this issue, this work presents an unsupervised anomaly detection approach for wind turbine condition monitoring, where a spatiotemporal graphical modeling method, spatiotemporal pattern network (STPN), is applied to extract the spatial and temporal features between the variables in the system, and an energy-based model, stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is used to capture the system-wide patterns and then applied for condition monitoring. Case studies on three data sets are carried out including: (1) anomaly detection on a benchmark model for fault detection and isolation, (2) anomaly detection on an experimental data set with the normal condition and 11 fault conditions and (3) online condition monitoring using real data from a wind farm in northwest China. The results show that the proposed approach is capable of detecting the anomalies without the need for labeling data. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a model-based fault detection method for fault detection of gearboxes in offshore wind turbines is presented. The main aim of this paper is to support conceptual studies with more emphasis on early fault detection methods for floating wind turbines. The method is introduced and applied on a 5-MW reference gearbox installed on a spar-type floating wind turbine. Faults applied on the main bearing, high and intermediate speed shaft bearings, and the planet bearing are examined with this method. The gearbox is modelled in a multibody simulation environment with high fidelity. The 5-MW gearbox model used in this study is an offshore reference gearbox that consists of 3 stages, 2 planetary and 1 parallel stages, which is supported in a 4-point configuration layout. The bearing faults are detected through the angular velocity error function. The angular velocity measurements are performed at input, output shafts, and 2 additional sensors inside the gearbox. The aim of the method is also to detect the fault through the external sensorsinput and output shaftsmeasurements, which can be embedded in the existing control system. The results reveal the possibility of early fault detection by this method for large floating wind turbines.

AB The use of signal processing for condition monitoring of wind turbines data has been on-going since several decades. Failure in the analysis of high modulated data may make the machine break. An example of this is the reported real case of bearing failure on a Repower wind turbine, which could not be detected by currently applied methods. The machine had to be out of service immediately after a faulty bearing outer race was visually ascertained. Vibration dataset from this faulty machine was provided to facilitate research into wind turbines analysis and with the hope that the authors of this work can improve upon the existing techniques. In the response to this challenge, the authors of this paper proposed Spectral Kurtosis (SK) and Signal Intensity Estimator (SIE) as proven time-frequency fault indicators to tackle the question of data with different modulation rates. Extensive signal processing using time domain and time-frequency domain analysis was undertaken. It was concluded that SIE is well established mature approach and it provides a more reliable estimate of wind turbine conditions than conventional techniques such as SK, leading to better discrimination between "good" and "bad" machines.

AB Determining the magnitude of particular fault signature components (FSCs) generated by wind turbine (WT) faults from current signals has been used as an effective way to detect early abnormalities. However, the WT current signals are time varying due to the constantly varying generator speed. The WT frequently operates with the generator close to the synchronous speed, resulting in FSCs manifesting themselves in the vicinity of the supply frequency and its harmonics, making their detection more challenging. To address this challenge, the detection of rotor electrical asymmetry in WT doubly fed induction generators, indicative of common winding, brush gear, or high resistance connection faults, has been investigated using a test rig under three different driving conditions, and then an effective extended Kalman filter (EKF) based method is proposed to iteratively estimate the FSCs and track their magnitudes. The proposed approach has been compared with a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and an iterative localized discrete Fourier-transform (IDFT). The experimental results demonstrate that the CWT and IDFT algorithms fail to track the FSCs at low load operation near-synchronous speed. In contrast, the EKF was more successful in tracking the FSCs magnitude in all operating conditions, unambiguously determining the severity of the faults over time and providing significant gains in both computational efficiency and accuracy of fault diagnosis.

AB An effective condition monitoring system of wind turbines generally requires installation of a high number of sensors and use of a high sampling frequency in particular for monitoring of the electrical components within a turbine, resulting in a large amount of data. This can become a burden for condition monitoring and fault detection systems. This paper aims to develop algorithms that will allow a reduced dataset to be used in wind turbine fault detection. This paper first proposes a variable selection algorithm based on principal component analysis with multiple selection criteria in order to select a set of variables to target fault signals while still preserving the variation of data in the original dataset. With the selected variables, this paper then describes fault detection and identification algorithms, which can identify faults, determine the corresponding time and location where the fault occurs, and estimate its severity. The proposed algorithms are evaluated with simulation data from PSCAD/EMTDC, Supervisory control and data acquisition data from an operational wind farm, and experimental data from a wind turbine test rig. Results show that the proposed methods can select a reduced set of variables with minimal information last whilst detecting faults efficiently and effectively.

AB The oil and gas industry faces increasing pressure to remove people from dangerous offshore environments. Robots present a cost-effective and safe method for inspection, repair, and maintenance of topside and marine offshore infrastructure. In this work, we introduce a new multi-sensing platform, the Limpet, which is designed to be low-cost and highly manufacturable, and thus can be deployed in huge collectives for monitoring offshore platforms. The Limpet can be considered an instrument, where in abstract terms, an instrument is a device that transforms a physical variable of interest (measurand) into a form that is suitable for recording (measurement). The Limpet is designed to be part of the ORCA (Offshore Robotics for Certification of Assets) Hub System, which consists of the offshore assets and all the robots (Underwater Autonomous Vehicles, drones, mobile legged robots etc.) interacting with them. The Limpet comprises the sensing aspect of the ORCA Hub System. We integrated the Limpet with Robot Operating System (ROS), which allows it to interact with other robots in the ORCA Hub System. In this work, we demonstrate how the Limpet can be used to achieve real-time condition monitoring for offshore structures, by combining remote sensing with signal-processing techniques. We show an example of this approach for monitoring offshore wind turbines, by designing an experimental setup to mimic a wind turbine using a stepper motor and custom-designed acrylic fan blades. We use the distance sensor, which is a Time-of-Flight sensor, to achieve the monitoring process. We use two different approaches for the condition monitoring process: offline and online classification. We tested the offline classification approach using two different communication techniques: serial and Wi-Fi. We performed the online classification approach using two different communication techniques: LoRa and optical. We train our classifier offline and transfer its parameters to the Limpet for online classification. We simulated and classified four different faults in the operation of wind turbines. We tailored a data processing procedure for the gathered data and trained the Limpet to distinguish among each of the functioning states. The results show successful classification using the online approach, where the processing and analysis of the data is done on-board by the microcontroller. By using online classification, we reduce the information density of our transmissions, which allows us to substitute short-range high-bandwidth communication systems with low-bandwidth long-range communication systems. This work shines light on how robots can perform on-board signal processing and analysis to gain multi-functional sensing capabilities, improve their communication requirements, and monitor the structural health of equipment.

AB The failure of wind turbine blades is a major concern in the wind power industry due to the resulting high cost. It is, therefore, crucial to develop methods to monitor the integrity of wind turbine blades. Different methods are available to detect subsurface damage but most require close proximity between the sensor and the blade. Thermography, as a non-contact method, may avoid this problem. Both passive and active pulsed and step heating and cooling thermography techniques were investigated for different purposes. A section of a severely damaged blade and a small "plate" cut from the undamaged laminate section of the blade with holes of varying diameter and depth drilled from the rear to provide "known" defects were monitored. The raw thermal images captured by both active and passive thermography demonstrated that image processing was required to improve the quality of the thermal data. Different image processing algorithms were used to increase the thermal contrasts of subsurface defects in thermal images obtained by active thermography. A method called "Step Phase and Amplitude Thermography", which applies a transform-based algorithm to step heating and cooling data was used. This method was also applied, for the first time, to the passive thermography results. The outcomes of the image processing on both active and passive thermography indicated that the techniques employed could considerably increase the quality of the images and the visibility of internal defects. The signal-to-noise ratio of raw and processed images was calculated to quantitatively show that image processing methods considerably improve the ratios.

AB Condition or health monitoring techniques and methods have been widely used for engineering systems fault detection and diagnosis. However, there is a major challenge with monitoring the systems operating under time varying loadings especially when the system loads are unknown or hard to measure. To address this problem, a new concept, wavelet energy transmissibility function, is proposed in this paper. The main advantage of this new method is that it can remove the impact of varying loadings but it does not require any loading information. Further, the proposed method is robust to noise and is sensitive to system property changes. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been well demonstrated by a numerical example, the theoretical study, and the analysis of the field vibration data from bearings of operating wind turbines.

AB Wind turbine condition-monitoring and fault diagnosis have important practical value for wind farms to reduce maintenance cost and improve operating level. Due to the special distribution law of the operating parameters of similar turbines, this paper compares the instantaneous operation parameters of four 1.5 MW turbines with strong correlation of a wind farm. The temperature-power distribution of the gearbox bearings is analyzed to find out the main trend of the turbines and the deviations of individual turbine parameters. At the same time, for the huge amount of data caused by the increase of turbines number and monitoring parameters, this paper uses the huge neural network and multi-hidden layer of a convolutional neural network to model historical data. Finally, the rapid warning and judgment of gearbox bearing over-temperature faults proves that the monitoring method is of great significance for large-scale wind farms.

AB Two Converter Monitoring Units (CMU) which were retrofitted in a multi Mega Watt wind turbine converter are presented. Synchronized sampling of semiconductor voltage (vce(on)) and semiconductor current (i(c)) enables the condition monitoring of the power modules. A vce(on) measurement circuitry for field operation is presented. A novel method of numerical integration of Rogowski coil voltage enables current sensing. Data from a whole year of operation show that the presented methods are consistent throughout long term operation, and that both the measurement principles and reference functions (model) are consistent during long time operation. It is thus expected that degradation of power modules and gate drives can be monitored.

ID ENERGY HARVESTERS DRIVEN; PERFORMANCE
AB Planetary gearbox fault diagnosis is very important for reducing the downtime, maintenance cost, and for improving the safety, reliability, and lifespan of wind turbines. The present work reports the results concluded by long-term experiments to a defected planetary gearbox system, with a transverse cut with a depth of 1.0 mm and thickness of 0.2 mm to simulate the planetary gearbox component crack. For each defect, recordings every 60.0 min were acquired and a total of 7 recordings (similar to 6.0 h of test duration) were resulted until the termination of the test. Fault is assured by increasing the test period to the point of where the remaining metal in the tooth area has enough stress to be in the plastic deformation region. An experimental procedure is developed to assess the severity of the gearbox component fault. Gearbox components faults of cracked planet gear tooth, cracked planet gears carrier, and cracked main bearing inner race were tested under accelerated fault conditions, where a comparative analysis of condition monitoring indicators for various crack detection has been done. The experimental localized fault signals (vibration acceleration signals) were subjected to the same diagnostic techniques such as spectrum comparisons, spectral kurtosis analysis, skewness analysis, and crest factor analysis. The method is validated on a set of seeded localized faults on all gears and components: sun gear, ring gear, etc. The results look promising, where the root mean square value analysis could be a good indicator when compared with the other indicators in terms of early detection and characterization of faults.

AB The penetration of wind energy into power systems is steadily increasing; this highlights the importance of operations and maintenance, and specifically the role of condition monitoring. Wind turbine power curves based on supervisory control and data acquisition data provide a cost-effective approach to wind turbine health monitoring. This study proposes a Gaussian process (a non-parametric machine learning approach) based algorithm for condition monitoring. The standard IEC binned power curve together with individual bin probability distributions can be used to identify operational anomalies. The IEC approach can also be modified to create a form of real-time power curve. Both of these approaches will be compared with a Gaussian process model to assess both speed and accuracy of anomaly detection. Significant yaw misalignment, reflecting a yaw control error or fault, results in a loss of power. Such a fault is quite common and early detection is important to prevent loss of power generation. Yaw control error provides a useful case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and allows the advantages and limitations of the proposed methods to be determined.

AB With the rapid development of wind energy, it is important to reduce operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of wind turbines (WTs), especially for a pitch system, which suffers the highest failure rate and downtime. This paper proposes a data-driven method for pitch- system condition monitoring (CM) by only using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data without any faults, which could be applied to reduce O&M costs of pitch system by providing fault alarms. The pitch-motor temperature is selected as the indicator, and three feature-selection algorithms are employed to select the most appropriate input parameters for modeling. Six data-driven algorithms are applied to model pitch-motor temperature and the support vector regression (SVR) model has the highest accuracy. The control-chart method based on the residual errors between model output and measured value is utilized to calculate the outliers, thus the abnormal condition could be clearly identified once the outliers appear for a period of time. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by several case studies, and compared with the classification models. Due to the adaptive ability and low cost, the proposed approach is suitable for online CM of pitch systems, and provides a strategy for CM of new WTs.

AB Increasing the reliability and the downtime of wind turbines is critical to minimise the cost of energy (COE) in the wind sector, especially for offshore wind turbines. Due to the high impact that gearboxes and generator downtimes create on wind turbines, reliable and cost-effective condition monitoring systems (CMS) for the drive train are a great concern to the wind industry. This manuscript presents an approach for condition health monitoring and fault diagnosis in wind turbine gearboxes and generators by means of analysing the power dependant vibrations gathered. This methodology is based on the establishment of the normal operation boundaries for carrying out the identification of deviations related to a defect. The validity of the baseline is studied using q-factor and probability of detection (POD) concepts. Given the nonlinear and nonstationary nature of the faulty vibration signals, envelope analysis is proposed as a demodulation technique to be applied to the signals, prior to the frequency response being extracted. The methodology is validated by field trials in a WINDMASTER300 wind turbine. Baselines for the generator and gearbox were produced as a tool to detect future faults developed within the turbine. Envelope analysis makes the identification of the vibrational frequencies representative of failure very likely. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB An electrical signature analysis (ESA)-based method to detect bearing defects in electromechanical drivetrains (e.g., wind turbines) is proposed in this paper. The novelty of the proposed technique is justified by its capability to detect a defect that occurs in a drivetrain bearing, external to the machine. Unlike the traditional vibration-based method, the electrical measurements of the terminal machine are utilized in this case to perform the fault detection. The proposed ESA-based method is developed utilizing a new electrical signal model of bearing defect, proposed in this paper, based on the excitation of torsional resonances. The proposed ESA-based method and the signal model are validated through experimental tests. The proposed technique demonstrates excellent fault detection capability even at low operating speed, which is advantageous over the traditional vibration-based method in terms of sensor cost, installation complexity, and detection reliability.

AB Monitoring wind turbine blade breakages based on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data is investigated in this research. A preliminary data analysis is performed to demonstrate that existing SCADA features are unable to present irregular patterns prior to occurrences of blade breakages. A deep autoencoder (DA) model is introduced to derive an indicator of impending blade breakages, the reconstruction error (RE), from SCADA data. The DA model is a neural network of multiple hidden layers organized symmetrically. In training DA models, the restricted Boltzmann machine is applied to initialize weights and biases. The back-propagation method is subsequently employed to further optimize the network structure. Through examining SCADA data, we observe that the trend of RE will shift by the blade breakage. To effectively detect RE shifts through online monitoring, the exponentially weighted moving average control chart is deployed. The effectiveness of the proposed monitoring approach is validated by blade breakage cases collected from wind farms located in China. The computational results prove the capability of the proposed monitoring approach in identifying impending blade breakages.

AB With the increase of wind power capacity worldwide, researchers are focusing their attention on the operation and maintenance of wind turbines. A proper pitch controller must be designed to extend the life cycle of a wind turbine's blades and tower. The pitch control system has two primaries, but conflicting, objectives: to maximize the wind energy captured and converted into electrical energy and to minimize fatigue and mechanical load. Four metrics have been proposed to balance these two objectives. Also, diverse pitch controller strategies are proposed in this paper to evaluate these objectives. This paper proposes a novel metrics approach to achieve the conflicting objectives with a maintenance focus. It uses a 100 kW wind turbine as a case study to simulate the proposed pitch control strategies and evaluate with the metrics proposed. The results are shown in two tables due to two different wind models are used.

AB Operation and maintenance costs are significant for large-scale wind turbines and particularly so for offshore. A well-organized operation and maintenance strategy is vital to ensure the reliability, availability, and cost-effectiveness of a system. The ability to detect, isolate, estimate, and perform prognoses on component degradation could become essential to reduce unplanned maintenance and downtime. Failures in gearbox components are in focus since they account for a large share of wind turbine downtime. This study considers detection and estimation of wear in the downwind main-shaft bearing of a 5-MW spar-type floating turbine. Using a high-fidelity gearbox model, we show how the downwind main bearing and nacelle axial accelerations can be used to evaluate the condition of the bearing. The paper shows how relative acceleration can be evaluated using statistical change-detection methods to perform a reliable estimation of wear of the bearing. It is shown in the paper that the amplitude distribution of the residual accelerations follows a t-distribution and a change-detection test is designed for the specific changes we observe when the main bearing becomes worn. The generalized likelihood ratio test is extended to fit the particular distribution encountered in this problem, and closed-form expressions are derived for shape and scale parameter estimation, which are indicators for wear and extent of wear in the bearing. The results in this paper show how the proposed approach can detect and estimate wear in the bearing according to desired probabilities of detection and false alarm.

AB Due to the presence of an abundant resource, wind energy is one of the most promising renewable energy resources for power generation globally, and there is constant need to reduce operation and maintenance costs to make the wind industry more profitable. Unexpected failures of turbine components make operation and maintenance (O&M) expensive, and because of transport and availability issues, the O&M cost is much higher in offshore wind farms (typically 30% of the levelized cost). To overcome this, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) based predictive condition monitoring can be applied to remotely identify early failures and limit downtime, boost production and decrease the cost of energy (COE). A Gaussian Process is a nonlinear, nonparametric machine learning approach which is widely used in modelling complex nonlinear systems. In this paper, a Gaussian Process algorithm is proposed to estimate operational curves based on key turbine critical variables which can be used as a reference model in order to identify critical wind turbine failures and improve power performance. Three operational curves, namely, the power curve, rotor speed curve and blade pitch angle curve, are constructed using the Gaussian Process approach for continuous monitoring of the performance of a wind turbine. These developed GP operational curves can be useful for recognizing failures that force the turbines to underperformand result in downtime. Historical 10-min SCADA data are used for the model training and validation.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Regular inspection for the maintenance of the wind turbines is difficult because of their remote locations. For this reason, condition monitoring systems (CMSs) are typically installed to monitor their health condition. The purpose of this study is to propose a fault detection algorithm for the mechanical parts of the wind turbine. To this end, long-term vibration data were collected over two years by a CMS installed on a 3 MW wind turbine. The vibration distribution at a specific rotating speed of main shaft is approximated by the Weibull distribution and its cumulative distribution function is utilized for determining the threshold levels that indicate impending failure of mechanical parts. A Hidden Markov model (HMM) is employed to propose the statistical fault detection algorithm in the time domain and the method whereby the input sequence for HMM is extracted is also introduced by considering the threshold levels and the correlation between the signals. Finally, it was demonstrated that the proposed HMM algorithm achieved a greater than 95% detection success rate by using the long-term signals.

AB Oil condition monitoring is a common practice in the wind industry. However, the published research about oil degradation in wind turbine gearboxes is limited. This paper aims at providing new information on the oil degradation process by analyzing wind turbine gearbox oils aged in the laboratory and in the field. Oil samples were analyzed in the laboratory and two sensors were used to determine the oil condition by means of dielectric constant and conductivity measurements. Additionally, micropitting tests were carried out for three oils with different base stocks. The results of this study show that viscosity changes of the oils from the field were not significant.Extreme pressure additives depletion and the increase of the iron content are among the most relevant degradation indicators. The oil sensors used in this study provided limited information on the oil degradation process. The accuracy of the sensors was affected by the oil type and its measurement range. The results of the micropitting tests showed that even aged oils exhibited a high micropitting resistance.

AB This paper presents analysis and modelling of synergistic wear-corrosion performance of Nickel-Graphene (Ni/ GPL) nanocomposite coating and compares it with un-coated steel 1020 under reciprocating-sliding contact. A novel synergistic wear-corrosion prediction model incorporating Archard description with nano-mechanics and electrochemistry was developed for Ni/GPL and steel 1020. The model is equally applicable to any kind of nanocomposite coating and bulk material like metals. For various nanocomposite coatings; their respective mechanical parameters should be used as inputs such as poisons ratio (v), Elastic Modulus (E), Hardness (H), Coefficient of Thermal Elastic mismatch (CTE) and intrinsic grain size (Do). The synergistic wear-corrosion effects were significantly-prominent in steel compared to Ni/GPL especially under contaminated lubricating oil conditions. This behaviour of Ni/GPL attributes to compact, refined grain structure leading to minimal grain pull-out during wear cycles which was also assured by less severe micro-ploughing in Ni/GPL compared to severe micro cutting in. steel. The predictions and experimental results were in good-agreement. Modelling of synergistic effects of wear-corrosion applied to nano-composite coatings have never been presented prior to this research. The significance of this work in terms of precision based wear-corrosion synergistic analysis, modelling and predictive techniques is evident from various industrial applications. This work will bring impacts for both in-situ and remote sensor based condition monitoring techniques to automotive, locomotive, aerospace, precision manufacturing and wind turbine industries.

AB A well-established condition-based maintenance (CBM) method based on condition monitoring information can be used to reduce maintenance costs by decimating unnecessary maintenance actions, reducing system downtime, and minimizing unexpected failures. In this paper, we propose an opportunistic CBM optimization approach for offshore wind turbines (OWTs) in which economic dependence exists among the components that are subjected to condition monitoring. An artificial neural network is used to predict life percentage by leveraging the condition monitoring information. A conditional failure probability value that is derived from the predicted failure-time distribution of the component was adopted to represent the deterioration of OWTs. Our maintenance method can be defined by a threshold with two-level failure probability. We propose a simulation method that can be used to calculate the optimal threshold values to minimize the long-term maintenance cost. Failure information and maintenance cost of OWTs are collected from existing articles to illustrate the proposed approach. Results show that the opportunistic CBM strategy can be effective and is established in the wind power industry. Moreover, the expense comparison between onshore and offshore WTs demonstrates the importance of this method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The rapid development of modern wind turbine technology has led to increasing demand for improving system reliability and practical concern for robust fault monitoring scheme. This paper presents the investigation of a 5 MW Dynamic Wind Turbine Energy System that was designed to sustain condition monitoring and fault diagnosis with the goal of improving the reliability operations of universal practical control systems. A hybrid stochastic technique is proposed based on an augmented observer combined with eigenstructure assignment for the parameterisation and the genetic algorithm (GA) optimisation to address the attenuation of uncertainty mostly generated by disturbances. Scenarios-based are employed to explore sensor and actuator faults that have direct and indirect impacts on modern wind turbine system, based on monitoring components that are prone to malfunction. The analysis is aimed to determine the effect of concerned simulated faults from uncertainty in respect to environmental disturbances mostly challenged in real-world operations. The efficiency of the proposed approach will improve the reliability performance of wind turbine system states and diagnose uncertain faults simultaneously. The simulation outcomes illustrate the robustness of the dynamic turbine systems with a diagnostic performance to advance the practical solutions for improving reliable systems.

AB A converter monitoring unit (CMU), which will enable condition monitoring of wind turbine converters is presented in this paper. Reducing the cost of corrective maintenance by means of condition monitoring is a way of lowering operation and maintenance costs for wind turbine systems. The CMU must be able to detect a broad range of failure modes related to Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) power modules and associated gate drives. IGBT collector-emitter on-state voltage (vce(on)) and current (ic) is sampled in the CMU and used for detection of emerging failures. A new method for compensation of unwanted inductive voltage drop in the vceon measurement path is presented, enabling retrofitting of CMUs in existing wind turbines. Finally, experimental results obtained on a prototype CMU are presented. Experimentally the vceon dependency to IGBT junction temperature and deterioration of gate drive voltage is investigated. The proposed method shows good detectability of both thermally related degradations of the power module and detectability of deterioration of gate drive voltage. It is also expected that the proposed method will enable detectability of other failure mechanisms.

AB The goal of the present paper is to achieve the diagnosis of an in-service 1.5 MW wind turbine equipped with a doubly-fed induction generator through current signature and vibration analyses. Real data from operating machines have rarely been analysed in the scientific literature through current signature analysis supported by vibrations. The wind turbine under study was originally misdiagnosed by the operator, where a healthy component was replaced and the actual failure continued progressing. The chronological evolution of both the electrical current and vibration spectra is presented to conduct an in-depth tracking of the fault. The diagnosis is achieved through spectral analysis of the stator currents, where fault frequency components related to rotor mechanical unbalance are identified. This is confirmed by the vibration analysis, which provides insightful information on the health of the drive train. These results can be implemented in condition monitoring strategies, which is of great interest to optimise operation and maintenance costs of wind farms.

AB This article states a condition monitoring strategy for wind turbines using a statistical data-driven modeling approach by means of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data. Initially, a baseline data-based model is obtained from the healthy wind turbine by means of multiway principal component analysis (MPCA). Then, when the wind turbine is monitorized, new data is acquired and projected into the baseline MPCA model space. The acquired SCADA data are treated as a random process given the random nature of the turbulent wind. The objective is to decide if the multivariate distribution that is obtained from the wind turbine to be analyzed (healthy or not) is related to the baseline one. To achieve this goal, a test for the equality of population means is performed. Finally, the results of the test can determine that the hypothesis is rejected (and the wind turbine is faulty) or that there is no evidence to suggest that the two means are different, so the wind turbine can be considered as healthy. The methodology is evaluated on a wind turbine fault detection benchmark that uses a 5 MW high-fidelity wind turbine model and a set of eight realistic fault scenarios. It is noteworthy that the results, for the presented methodology, show that for a wide range of significance, alpha is an element of[1%, 13%], the percentage of correct decisions is kept at 100%; thus it is a promising tool for real-time wind turbine condition monitoring.

AB This article offers reasons to defend the use of generic behavior models as opposed to specific models in applications to determine component degradation. The term generic models refers to models based on operating data from various units, whereas specific models are calculated using operating data taken from a single unit. Moreover, generic models, used in combination with a status indicator, show excellent capacity for detecting anomalies in the equipment and for evaluating the effectiveness of the maintenance actions, resulting in lower development and maintenance costs for the operating firm. Artificial neural networks and moving means were used to calculate the degradation indicators, based on the remainders in the model. The models were developed from operating data from fourteen wind turbines monitored over several years, and applied to the detection of faults in the bearings on the non-drive end of the generator. The use of generic models may not be recommendable for detecting faults in all cases, and the suitability will depend greatly on the context of the methodology developed to detect each type of fault, according to the element causing the fault and the fault mode, since each methodology requires a greater or lesser degree of precision in the model.

Both fault diagnosis and monitoring can be achieved without using a model for the wind turbine, applied controller, or wind profiles. The method is based on measurements from standard sensors on modern wind turbines, including moment sensors and rotor angle sensors. This approach will allow the method to be applied to existing wind turbines without any modifications. The method is based on the detection of asymmetries in the rotor system caused by changes or faults in the rotor system. A multiblade coordinate transformation is used directly on the measured flap-wise and edge-wise moments followed by signal modulation. Changes or faults in the rotor system will result in unique signatures in the set of modulation signals. These signatures are described through the amplitudes and phase information of the modulation signals. It is possible to detect and isolate which blade is faulty or has been changed based on these signatures. Furthermore, the faulty component can be isolated, ie, the actuator, sensor or blade, and the type of fault can be determined. The method can be used both on- and off-line.

AB One of the most challenging scenarios in bearing diagnosis is the extraction of fault signatures from within other strong components which mask the vibration signal. Usually, the bearing vibration signals are dominated by those of other components such as gears and shafts. A good example of this scenario is the wind turbine gearbox which presents one of the most difficult bearing detection tasks. The non stationary signal analysis is considered one of the main topics in the field of machinery fault diagnosis. In this paper, a set of signal processing techniques has been studied to investigate their feasibility for bearing fault detection in wind turbine gearbox. These techniques include statistical condition indicators, spectral kurtosis, and envelope analysis. The results of vibration analysis showed the possibility of bearing fault detection in wind turbine high-speed shafts using multiple signal processing techniques. However, among these signal processing techniques, spectral kurtosis followed by envelope analysis provides early fault detection compared to the other techniques employed. In addition, outer race bearing fault indicator provides clear indication of the crack severity and progress. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to improve the reliability and availability of the converters of wind turbines, condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are considered crucial means to achieve these goals. In this text, according to the current variation characteristics of the converter, this paper presents a novel approach for real-time diagnostics of open-switch faults in back-to-back converters of a doubly fed wind turbine. The average value of the normalized converter phase currents and the absolute normalized currents are used as principal quantities to formulate the diagnostic variables. The proposed fault-diagnostic variables prove to be carrying information about multiple open-switch faults. In addition to, by the combination of these variables with the average absolute values of the normalized converter phase currents, an adaptive fault-diagnostic threshold is proposed, which ensures the robustness of the diagnosis of single and double open-switch faults. Finally, through the diagnostic variables and the adaptive threshold, the dynamic fault-diagnostic method for open-switch faults in the back-to-back converter of a doubly fed wind turbine is formed. The simulation and experimental results also indicate that the fault-diagnostic method can not only diagnose the multiple open-circuit faults of a back-to-back converter, but also have a better robustness.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB To improve the reliability of wind turbines, various condition monitoring systems (CMSs) have been developed and most of them transmit data using wired communication channels. Recently, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been used to transmit data in wind turbine CMS due to the low cost and easy deployment feature of WSNs. However, since wind turbines are installed in harsh environments, the sensors and sensor nodes used in the WSN-based wind turbine CMSs are easily subject to faults, leading to corruption of the signals used for condition monitoring, which decreases the reliability of the CMS. This paper proposes a three-stage method for the detection and isolation of three most common sensor faults, i.e., SHORT fault, CONSTANT fault, and NOISE fault, in WSN-based wind turbine CMS. The proposed sensor fault detection and isolation greatly increases the accuracy and reliability of wind turbine CMSs. Data collected from wind turbines in the field are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Fault diagnosis of drivetrain gearboxes is a prominent challenge in wind turbine condition monitoring. Many machine learning algorithms have been applied to gearbox fault diagnosis. However, many of the current machine learning algorithms did not provide satisfactory fault diagnosis results due to their shallow architectures. Recently, a class of machine learning models with deep architectures called deep learning has received more attention, because it can learn high-level features of inputs. This paper proposes a new fault diagnosis method for the drivetrain gearboxes of the wind turbines equipped with doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) using DFIG rotor current signal analysis. In the proposed method, the instantaneous fundamental frequency of the rotor current signal is first estimated to obtain the instantaneous shaft rotating frequency. Then, the Hilbert transform is used to demodulate the rotor current signal to obtain its envelope, and the resultant envelope signal contains fault characteristic frequencies that are in proportion to the varying DFIG shaft rotating frequency. Next, an angular resampling algorithm is designed to resample the nonstationary envelope signal to be stationary based on the estimated instantaneous shaft rotating frequency. After that, the power spectral density analysis is performed on the resampled envelope signal for the gearbox fault detection. Finally, a classifier with a deep architecture that consists of a stacked autoencoder and a support vector machine is proposed for gearbox fault classification using extracted fault features. Experimental results obtained from a DFIG wind turbine drivetrain test rig are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB As a critical component, failures of high-speed shaft bearing in wind turbines cause the unplanned stoppage of electrical energy production. Investigations related to naturally progressed defects of high-speed shaft bearings are relatively scarce and the online assessment in damage severities is rarely available in the literature. In this sense, this paper presents a new online vibration-based diagnosis method for wind turbine high-speed bearing monitoring. The adaptive resonance theory 2 (ART2) is proposed for an unsupervised classification of the extracted features. The Randall model is adapted considering the geometry of the tested bearing to train the ART2 in the offline step. In fact, the time domain, the frequency domain, and the time-frequency domain are investigated for a better bearing fault characterization. Indeed, the use of real measured data from a wind turbine drivetrain proves that the proposed data-driven approach is suitable for wind turbine bearings online condition monitoring even under real experimental conditions. This method reveals a better generalization capability compared to previous works even with noisy measurements.

AB In order to reduce the structural failure and accident occurrence of the offshore wind turbine, the researches on structural operational safety of offshore wind turbine based on the measured data during the operation periods should be carried out and considered as the key way to solve these problems. However, the current researches are only focused on numerical simulation, model experiment and theoretical analysis and ignore the structural vibration characteristics analyzed from condition monitoring and prototype observation data from the actual wind turbine structure. To compensate for this study defect, the structural vibration displacement signals of one Chinese offshore wind power prototype under different conditions were obtained based on a long-term prototype observation in order to achieve the comprehensive and systematic research on vibration response characteristics and operational modal analysis of measured structure. Considering the complicated operational environment of offshore wind turbines, the structural response regular pattern and vibration safety are also discussed emphatically under different conditions such as standstill, normal operational, startup, shutdown and extreme typhoon status. Simultaneously, the integral operational modal identification method of offshore wind turbine in the range of full power is proposed based on traditional and modified stochastic subspace identification technologies, and further the modal identification results and the relationship between structural modal parameters and environmental/operational factors are also illustrated in this paper. The researches on the structural vibration characteristics and operational modal analysis of offshore wind turbine not only provide powerful data and technology support for the operation safety evaluation, but also provide the necessary theoretical and practical bases for the design and maintenance of wind turbine structures.

AB As wind energy continues to develop with increasing wind turbine power capacities often deployed offshore, reducing operation and maintenance costs have become a critical aspect. Condition monitoring has been found to be the key to achieve this goal. Under this framework, the induction generator of a wind turbine is a major contributor to failure rates and downtime where doubly-fed induction generators are the dominant technology employed. This paper presents a spectral analysis of a real doubly-fed induction generator of an in-service wind turbine. A one-year measurement campaign on an operating wind turbine has been used to perform the study. Three test cases representing different wind turbine operating conditions are presented to illustrate the results. All the peaks found in the spectra have been identified, and the frequency components related to electrical rotor unbalance have been found. The results show which components are more suitable for effective condition monitoring. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a new methodology based on cointegration analysis of Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) data for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of wind turbines. Analysis of cointegration residuals obtained from cointegration process of wind turbine data is used for operational condition monitoring and automated fault and/or abnormal condition detection. The proposed method is validated using the experimental data acquired from a wind turbine drivetrain with a nominal power of 2 MW under varying environmental and operational conditions. A two-stage cointegration-based procedure is performed on six process parameters of the wind turbine, where data trends have nonlinear characteristics. The method is tested using two case studies with known faults. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively analyse nonlinear data trends, continuously monitor the wind turbine and reliably detect abnormal problems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ageing of a wind turbine and its components is inevitable. It will affect the reliability and power generation of the turbine over time. Therefore, performing the ageing assessment of wind turbines is of significance not only to optimize the operation and maintenance strategy of the wind turbine but also to improve the management of a wind farm. However, in contrast to the significant number of research on wind turbine condition monitoring and reliability analysis, little effort was made before to investigate the ageing led performance degradation issue of wind turbines over time. To fill such a technology gap, four SCADA-based wind turbine ageing assessment criteria are proposed in this paper for measuring the ageing resultant performance degradation of the turbine. With the aid of these four criteria, a reliable information fusion based wind turbine ageing assessment method is developed and verified in the end using the real wind farm SCADA data. It has been shown that the proposed method is effective and reliable in performing the ageing assessment of a wind turbine. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Icing blades require of advanced condition monitoring systems to reduce the failures and downtimes in Wind Turbine Blades (WTB). This paper presents a novel fault detection and diagnosis system that combines ultrasonic techniques with Wavelet transforms for detecting ice on the blades. Lamb waves were generated with Macro Fibre Composites (MFC) and collected with MFC. Ice affects to the normal propagation of the wave through the material of the blade. The changes in the signal are due to the forces that ice exercise on the surface. Three different scenarios were considered according to ISO 12494, 2001 (Atmospheric icing of structures): at room temperature; the frozen blade without accumulation of ice, and; the frozen blade with accumulation of ice on its surface. In order to validate the approach, Morlet wavelet transformation has been used for filtering the signal. The time-frequency analysis has been done by Wigner-Ville distribution. On the other hand, the envelope of the filtered signal by wavelet transforms is done by Hilbert Transform, and the pattern recognition is done by autocorrelations of the Hibert transforms. The approach detects the cases considered in ISO 12494 of unfrozen, frozen without ice, and frozen with ice in the WTB. New scenarios, considering mud, have been considered to test the approach.

AB Critical mechanical faults in wind turbine systems lead to considerable downtime and repair costs. Improving the detection and diagnosis of such faults thus brings about significant cost reductions for operations and maintenance (O&M) and electricity production. One of the most common defects in drivetrains are rolling element bearing faults. Detecting the faults in their incipient phase can prevent a more catastrophic breakdown and save a company time and money. This paper focuses on separating the bearing fault signals from masking signals coming from drivetrain elements like gears or shafts. The separation is based on the assumption that signal components of gears or shafts are deterministic and appear as clear peaks in the frequency spectrum, whereas bearing signals are stochastic due to random jitter on their fundamental period and can be classified as cyclostationary. A technique that recently gained more attention for separating these two types of signals is the cepstral editing procedure and it is investigated further in this paper as an automated procedure. The performance of the developed methods is validated on experimental data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the context of the wind turbine gearbox condition monitoring round robin study.

AB Electrical signature analysis-based (ESA-based) diagnostics of powertrain faults in wind turbines (WTs) is a promising alternative to the more traditional vibration-based condition monitoring. However, the attempt to identify mechanical faults in electrical signals requires the consideration of the complex electromechanical dynamics of the WT. This paper investigates the potential masking effect of power electronic switching and wind-induced speed fluctuations on the electrical signatures of typical powertrain mechanical faults (i.e. rotor imbalance, gear cracks and other localised faults). To identify the conditions in which these masking effects arise and their severity, an innovative full electromechanical model of a WT has been developed, based on the integration of previously proposed models of WT subsystems, and with the addition of powertrain fault models. This numerical controlled environment allows assessing the impact of power electronics and wind-speed fluctuation on the detectability of powertrain faults by ESA. The results show the criticality of switching-induced noise over the whole range of simulated faults, whereas turbulence-induced noise is mainly affecting the detectability of low frequency signatures. An order-of-magnitude sensitivity analysis is provided for the selected faults and their interaction with the two masking effects, thus providing valuable indications for the development of WT ESA-based condition monitoring systems.

AB Online condition monitoring is a crucial task for wind turbine generators availability and reliability enhancement and leads to early detection of both electrical and mechanical faults. This reduces the maintenance cost and avoid catastrophic failures. The performance of any condition monitoring system should be evaluated before its implementation in a full-scale system. Therefore, the design of a reduced-scale wind turbine generator including its main subsystem components at an initial stage is important for the assessment of new methods dedicated to the detection of both electrical and mechanical faults. This paper aims to demonstrate some capabilities of a formerly designed test bench based on a wound rotor induction generator in studying the effect of both electrical and mechanical faults on its electrical signatures. This system includes all required instrumentation in addition to a real-time platform for the development of any sophisticated condition monitoring strategy devoted to the online condition monitoring of wind turbines. A reduced-scale system based on a 5.5kW wound rotor induction machine is used for the validation of the proposed approach.

AB This paper deals with a technique for emulation of wind turbine systems which are based on wound rotor induction machine technology using a reduced-scale test bench. The development of new control algorithms and fault diagnosis techniques is the main aim of this emulation with which the efficacy of these novel strategies can be evaluated in working conditions similar to those of full-scale wind turbines. The reduced-scale test bench has been designed according to the main components of a full-scale wind turbine system namely the main bearing, the main shaft, the planetary gearbox and the wound rotor induction machine. A rotor side converter is involved to manage both active and reactive power exchange with the power grid. Moreover, an external real-time data acquisition platform is utilized for data collection from different elements of the test bench. This has been realized using different kinds of measurement which are the outcome of accelerometer, torque, current and voltage sensors that will be used for studying the efficacy of various approaches of wind turbines' condition monitoring. The parameters of a full-scale 600kW wind turbine have been used and adapted to a reduced-scale test bench setup based on a 5.5kW wound rotor induction machine for the validation of the proposed method.

AB Condition monitoring (CM) deliveries significant benefits to industries by reducing breakdown losses of machines and enhancing their safe and high-performance operations. Monitoring the machine conditions in real time using an appropriate wireless sensor network (WSN) has the advantages of the avoidance of cable usages, ease of system deployment and hence cost-effectiveness of CM implementation. One of the major challenges for WSN is the battery replacement. Generally, the batteries of sensor nodes are difficult to recharge or replace due to the inevitable layout at inaccessible or risky positions. Recently, energy harvesting (EH) applied to WSNs has increasingly caught the attention of researchers due to the ideal permanent non-maintenance requirements of the autonomous WSN nodes. This paper overviews the principles of several promising EH technologies (including photovoltaic, thermoelectric, pyroelectric, piezoelectric, electromagnetic, triboelectric EH technologies) used in various fields. In addition, the corresponding EH prototypes and fabricated products developed by various researchers are reviewed. After the discussion of the advantages and limitations of different technologies, the EH technologies are evaluated for further development of the energy harvesters to achieve a maintenance-free system for reliable monitoring machines. Finally, a discussion on challenges, applications and future developments of EH applied for machine CM is held.

AB In this paper, a multivariate statistical technique combined with a machine learning algorithm is proposed to provide a fault classification and feature extraction approach for the wind turbines. As the probability density distributions (PDDs) of the monitoring variables can illustrate the inner correlations among variables, the dominant factors causing the failure are figured out, with the comparison of PDD of the variables under the healthy and unhealthy scenarios. Then the selected variables are used for fault feature extraction by using kernel support vector machine (KSVM). The presented algorithms are implemented and assessed based on the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data acquired from an operational wind farm. The results show the features relating specifically to the faults are extracted to be able to identify and analyse different faults for the wind turbines.

   variable-weight combined
AB Predicting the temperature variables of the wind turbine gearbox precisely including the axis temperature and the oil temperature can evaluate the gearbox status in real time effectively. Concerning the limitations of a single prediction model, this paper proposes a variable-weight combined model to predict gearbox temperature based on the theory of grey relational degree. Firstly, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimension of the gearbox temperature related factors, and the time series is selected to analyze the internal structure of the gearbox temperature. Then,to analyze the gray correlation degree between the four single models and the actual temperature series, eliminate a certain dynamically model and to update the remaining models weights dynamically. Compared the variable-weight combined model with the equal-weight combined model and each single model, it is shown that the variable-weight combined prediction model has higher prediction accuracy, which is of great significance for further condition monitoring of the gearbox.

AB Unscheduled maintenance consumes a lot of time and effort and hence reduces the overall cost-effectiveness of wind turbines. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) based condition monitoring is a cost-effective approach to carry out diagnosis and prognosis of faults and to provide performance assessment of a wind turbine. The rotor speed based power curve, which describes the nonlinear relationship between wind turbine rotor speed and power output, is useful for performance appraisal of a wind turbine though limited work on this area has been undertaken to date. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a data-driven, nonparametric approach used for both classification and regression problems developed initially from statistical learning theory (SLT) by Vapnik. SVM is useful in forecasting and prediction applications.
   This paper deals with the application of support vector regression to estimate the rotor speed based power curve of a wind turbine and its usefulness in identifying potential faults. It is compared with a conventional approach based on a binned rotor speed power curve to identify operational anomalies. The comparative studies summarise the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques. SCADA data obtained from a healthy operational wind turbine is used to train and validate these methods.

AB In this paper, a diagnostic technique for the detection of rotor inter-turn short circuit faults in Doubly Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs) for wind power systems is designed. The aim is to improve the monitoring system of the DFIG through an appropriate maintenance, enhance operation and increase the reliability to extract the maximum of the wind energy. In this context, an advanced maintenance strategy based on the combination of the Time Synchronous Averaging (TSA) method and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is established. The proposed strategy has been implemented and verified using simulations built in MatLab C) SIMULINK environment. Various scenarios have been conducted for both faulty and healthy states of the rotor. The simulation results demonstrate the reliability and the efficiency of the proposed approach.

AB The objective of this research paper is the simulation modeling of wind turbine emulator (WTE), which is essential to make a test rig for Condition monitoring of wind turbine generator (WTG). Wind turbine characteristics are emulated by means of D.C machine. Further, the characteristics of wind turbine based on simulation results are discussed followed by a comprehensive discussion on the similarity of these characteristics with those of a D.C motor along with characteristics curves. The results and observations obtained in the present research verify the capability of WTE to vary the D.C motor torque as the replica of wind turbine rotor torque. The developed WTE allows a wind energy conversion system to be analyzed without the need of a real wind turbine.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Condition monitoring method is suggested in this paper using Machine Current Signal Analysis (MCSA) for analyzing Rotor eccentricity fault in Wind Turbine Generator (WTG). The suggested method measures the current characteristic frequencies generated by the WTG. Extraction and investigation of the excitations that are generated by WTG eccentricity fault are carried under, full load, no load and varying conditions of wind on a designed and developed test rig. FFT approach is used to calculate the side- band and wavelet-based analysis is further used to examine fault frequencies. Mean power at different resolution levels has been used to measure the fault magnitude. Experimentally, it has been demonstrated that for variable wind conditions MCSA lets suitable discrimination of faulty and healthy situations that lead to an effective method of diagnosis for condition monitoring (CM) of wind turbine (WT).

ID SIMULATION-MODEL
AB Monitoring blade tip movement of wind turbines is highly relevant for identifying imbalances and increased alternating loads. As sensor placement at blade tips is generally challenging, a light-weight low-profile MEMS acceleration sensor is used in this paper. A simulation of acceleration signals under wind effects such as wind shear, yaw and tower shadow was used to extract significant features, which were then applied to real world data. The dimensions of features in the simulation as well as in real world data were in alignment which proves the concept of the simulation, together with features found to correlate with the turbine's frequency. Findings strongly indicate that the approach is very promising for monitoring blade tip movement and identifying alternating loads.

AB WTCM (Wind Turbine Condition Monitoring) system is important for wind farm operators to realize condition-based O&M (operation & maintenance), in the purpose of reducing O&M cost and improving wind turbine reliability. A WTCM method using only SCADA data based on data mining algorithm is proposed in this paper. Firstly, ARD (Automatic Relevance Determination) algorithm is adopted to determine the effective variables that are relevant to wind turbine condition. Feature vector is then extracted using the effective variables to represent the operation condition of wind turbine. Finally, the condition of a wind turbine is determined using outlier detection algorithm based on the extracted feature vector. Real-world dataset is used to validate the efficiency of the proposed method. Experiment results show that the proposed method can provide advanced failure alarm for wind turbines many days before failure happens. O&M cost can be reduced by condition-based O&M strategy using the result of our proposed WTCM method.

AB As one of the critical components of wind turbines, pitch system suffers the highest failure rate and downtime. Thus, it is particularly important to improve the reliability and reduce the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of pitch system. With the development of condition monitoring (CM) technology, the condition based maintenance is often employed to reduce the O&M costs of wind turbines. This paper proposed a data-driven CM approach to identify the abnormal condition of pitch system, using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data. The result of the proposed approach could be useful for wind farm operators to improve their maintenance strategy. Firstly, the Relief algorithm is used to select the appropriated parameters as the health indicator for evaluating the condition of pitch system. Meanwhile, the correlation between the selected parameters is considered to remove the redundant variables. With the selected parameters as the model output and environment variables as the model input, then the random forest regression based model is established by only using the historical healthy SCADA data. Eventually, the distance calculated based on the residual errors between model output and monitored value is used to identify the abnormal condition of pitch system specifically. Several case studies have been analyzed to validate the feasibility of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method can detect the pitch system faults earlier than the SCADA alarm system. It is applicable for the on-line CM of pitch system because of simplicity and low cost.

AB Dynamical control system optimization and noise and vibration mitigation are particularly pressing issues as regards horizontal-axis small wind turbines. A peculiarity of this technology is that the generator constitutes a non-negligible fraction of the total mass and therefore the electromechanical coupling is relevant. Condition monitoring of small wind turbine generators is an overlooked topic in the literature and in the operation of these systems. This work is devoted to damage diagnosis on a permanent magnet generator of a horizontalaxis wind turbine having 3 kW of maximum power and 2 meters of rotor diameter. The experimental analysis is conducted through wind tunnel tests and on a generator test rig where a damaged and an undamaged generators have been driven at different rotational speeds. The test rig data are useful for studying the low-frequency tail of the spectrum, where the characteristic frequencies of the bearing are located. A fault in the cage of the bearing supporting the generator is diagnosed using the spectral coherence analysis.

AB Several studies have used the power curve as a critical indicator to assess the performance of wind turbines. However, the wind turbine internal operation is affected by various parameters, particularly by blade pitch angle. Continuous monitoring of blade pitch angle can be useful for power performance assessment of wind turbines. The blade pitch curve describes the nonlinear relationship between pitch angle and hub height wind speed which to date has been little explored for wind turbine condition monitoring. Gaussian Process models are nonlinear and nonparametric technique, based on Bayesian probability theory. Such models have the potential give results quickly and efficiently. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process model to predict blade pitch curve of a wind turbine for condition monitoring purposes. The obtained Gaussian Process based blade pitch curve is then compared with a conventional approach based on a binned blade pitch curve for identifying operational anomalies purposes. Finally, the weaknesses and strengths of these methods are summarised. SCADA data from healthy wind turbines are used to train and evaluate the performance of these techniques.

AB The technology of condition monitoring for wind farm operation has been used for many years, such as Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA). However, structural health monitoring (SHM) of the support structure is still at the research stage. In this paper an offshore structure monitoring system for the offshore wind turbine jacket structure is proposed. The major monitoring items include vibration, strain and corrosion. In addition to those corresponding sensors, other instruments are also included in the proposed system to evaluate the structural integrity of the offshore wind turbine jacket structure. A detailed description of the monitoring methods and the framework of system are provided which is expected to be applied to the real support structure in the future.

AB In this paper, a faulty diagnosis of rotor inter turn short circuit in Doubly Fed Induction Generators (DFIG) is established. The aim is to enhance the monitoring system of the wind turbine and the downtime of the DFIG. To achieve this goal, an efficient strategy based on the association of the Time Synchronous Averaging (TSA) technique and Current Signature Analysis (CSA) is developed. The proposed condition monitoring has been examined using simulations built in MatLab SIMULINK environment. Various scenarios have been conducted for a healthy operation and a defective case at different rotor defect levels. The simulation results prove that the elaborated method is practical and reliable, because of its simple stator current measure.

AB Machinery condition monitoring has entered the era of big data and some research has been done based on big data. Abnormal segments, such as missing segments and drift segments, are inevitable in big data acquired from harsh industrial environment due to temporary sensor failures, network segment transmission delays, or accidental loss of some collected data and so on. Being independent of the machinery condition, the abnormal segments not only reduce the quality of the data for condition monitoring and big data analysis, but also bring a heavy computation load. However, there are few reports to address abnormal segment detection for further data cleaning in the field of machinery condition monitoring. Therefore, an abnormal segment detection method is proposed to improve the quality of big data. First, a sliding window is used to separate the data into different segments. Then, 14 kinds of time-domain features are extracted from each segment and principle component analysis (PCA) is employed to extract the principle components from these features. In addition, local outlier factor (LOF) is calculated based on the principle components to evaluate the degree of being an outlier for each segment. Finally, the data, including a drift segment from a real wind turbine, are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The electrostatic sensing technique has been verified to be a viable method for tribo-contact monitoring under laboratory conditions in previous investigations. The monitoring of wind turbine gearbox is a possible approach for electrostatic application. It usually under variable operating conditions while working. This paper introduced a new method called moving window local outlier factor (MWLOF) to process electrostatic monitoring signals with multi-sensors. It can detect early faults earlier and has a better sensitivity with the information fusion method than conventional techniques, which leads to a better industrial application in future.

AB Wind power has become one of the leading clean and inexhaustible power sources of today's electricity generation. Wind turbines are significantly evolving with tremendous benefits, resulting in remarkable demand of installing and establishing new wind farms. One of the central dilemmas that face wind turbine is the unplanned downtime that considered to be one of the main revenue-loss factors of a modern wind farm In In a medium scale wind farm, the sensor fiber network is subject to fail due to the harsh environment leading to corruption of the signals used for condition monitoring. Due to the reasons above, the wind turbine is subject to be shut down because of not received sensor data via the wind turbine health monitoring system. Additionally, the shutdown mostly is not required since there are no high threshold sensor values that are related to stress on specific turbine hardware. Thus, in this paper, we propose a software-defined Network (SDN) quadcopter system that is based on a cloud testbed cluster as an immediate fail-over recovery system for faulty sensors to provide continuous sensor readings with no interruptions. Our proposed system helps in preventing the unnecessary shutdown of a wind turbine which will result in continuous revenues with no losses and reduce any power shortage overhead that may affect the power grid. The SDN controller is virtualized on the cluster with full topology management on sensor nodes. We have used Real-time wind turbine sensor data to simulate the failure scenario and, extensive testing showed the reliability of our proposed SDN testbed to assess the wind turbine condition and to maintain continuous power generation.

AB There is a correlation between two parameters in the data collected by the SCADA system of wind turbine. In this paper, SCADA parameters were related to each subsystem, and their correlations can be found according to the principle of wind turbine operation. The Polynomial Regression was used to establish normal relations matrix between two parameters in different wind speed. The distance between undetermined SCADA data relationship matrix and normal SCADA data relationship matrix was treated as the evaluation criteria. Based on SCADA data collected before a failure occurs of two wind turbine located in a wind farm of Zhangbei County, MATLAB was used to verify the validity of this method. The result confirmed that this method can reflect faults two months ahead of the SCADA system.

AB Wind industry experiences a tremendous growth during the last few decades. As of the end of 2016, the worldwide total installed electricity generation capacity from wind power amounted to 486,790 MW, presenting an increase of 12.5% compared to the previous year. Nowadays wind turbine manufacturers tend to adopt new business models proposing total health monitoring services and solutions, using regular inspections or even embedding sensors and health monitoring systems within each unit. Regularly planned or permanent monitoring ensures a continuous power generation and reduce maintenance costs, prompting specific actions when necessary. The core of wind turbine drivetrain is usually a complicated planetary gearbox. One of the main gearbox components which are commonly responsible for the machinery breakdowns are rolling element bearings. The failure signs of an early bearing damage are usually weak compared to other sources of excitation (e.g. gears). Focusing towards the accurate and early bearing fault detection, a plethora of signal processing methods have been proposed including spectral analysis, synchronous averaging and enveloping. Envelope analysis is based on the extraction of the envelope of the signal, after filtering around a frequency band excited by impacts due to the bearing faults. Kurtogram has been proposed and widely used as an automatic methodology for the selection of the filtering band, being on the other hand sensible in outliers. Recently an emerging interest has been focused on modelling rotating machinery signals as cyclostationary, which is a particular class of non stationary stochastic processes. Cyclic Spectral Correlation and Cyclic Spectral Coherence have been presented as powerful tools for condition monitoring of rolling element bearings, exploiting their cyclostationary behaviour. In this work a new diagnostic tool is introduced based on the integration of the Cyclic Spectral Coherence along a frequency band that contains the diagnostic information. A special procedure is proposed in order to automatically select the filtering band, maximizing the corresponding fault indicators. The effectiveness of the methodology is validated using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) wind turbine gearbox vibration condition monitoring benchmarking dataset which includes various faults with different levels of diagnostic complexity.

ID DIAGNOSTICS
AB Wind energy experiences a significant growth during the last decades but the industry is still challenged by premature turbine component failures, which are quite expensive due to the increase of turbines size. The core of wind turbine drivetrains is a planetary gearbox and its rolling element bearings are often responsible for machinery breakdowns. The failure signs of an early bearing damage are usually weak compared to the gear excitation and are hardly detected. As a result there is a special need for advanced signal processing tools which can detect accurately bearing faults. Cyclic Spectral Coherence (CSC) appears to be a strong diagnostic tool but its interpretation is complicated for a non-expert. In this paper a novel CSC based methodology is proposed in order to extract an Improved Envelope Spectrum exploiting a specific domain of the CSC map optimally selected by a proposed criterion. The methodology is tested and validated on a wind turbine gearbox benchmarking dataset provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), USA.

AB Operational data from wind farms is crucial for wind turbine condition monitoring and performance assessment. In this paper, we analyse three wind farms with the aim to monitor environmental and operational conditions that might result in underperformance or failures. The assessment includes a simple wind speed characterisation and wake analysis. The evolution of statistical parameters is used to identify anomalous turbine behaviour. In total, 88 turbines and 12 failures are analysed, covering different component failures. Notwithstanding the short period of data available, several operational parameters are found to deviate from the farm trend in some turbines affected by failures. As a result, some parameters show better monitoring capabilities than others, for the detection of certain failures. However, the limitations of SCADA statistics are also shown as not all failures showed anomalies in the observed parameters.

AB In this paper a model based approach for condition monitoring and diagnosis of faults in the wind turbine rotor blades is described. The investigation is focused on creating a fault-free reference system, the design and optimization of the controller/observer based on the Disturbance Accommodating Control theory and the multi-objective genetic optimization algorithm in order to further enhance the condition monitoring and faults diagnosis. Test cases are presented by injecting a parameter change, e.g. pitch angle, as an error to the non-linear wind turbine simulation model in order to demonstrate that the proposed method is able to detect the fault on the blades.

ID FAST COMPUTATION
AB Effectively monitoring the health of a wind turbine gearbox is a complex and often multidisciplinary endeavor. Recently, condition monitoring practices increasingly combine knowledge from fields like signal processing, machine learning, and mechanics. Such a diverse approach becomes necessary when dealing with the vast amount of data that is generated by the multitude of sensors that are typically placed on a wind turbine gearbox. Ideally, this approach needs to be automated and scalable as well, since it is unfeasible to perform all the necessary processing work manually in a continuous manner. This paper focuses on assessing the performance of such an automated processing framework for the case of gearbox fault detection using vibration measurements. A year of vibration measurements on a gearbox is simulated by stochastic variation of the operating conditions and the system behavior. A bearing fault is progressively introduced as to track the detection capabilities of the framework in such stochastic circumstances. The used signal model is based on previously obtained experience with experimental data sets originating from wind turbine gearboxes. The framework itself consists of multiple pre-processing steps where each step tries to deal with compensating for the external or unwanted influences such as speed variation or noise. Finally, multiple features are calculated on the pre-processed signals and trended as to see whether the processing scheme can provide any benefit compared to basic traditional statistical indicators. It is shown that the multi-step pre-processing approach is beneficial and robust for the advanced feature calculation and thus the early fault detection.

TI Fault Detection of Wind Turbine Sensors Using Artificial Neural Networks
SO JOURNAL OF SENSORS

DT Article
AB This paper proposes a method for sensor validation and fault detection in wind turbines. Ensuring validity of sensor measurements is a significant part in overall condition monitoring as sensor faults lead to incorrect results in monitoring a system's state of health. Although identifying abrupt failures in sensors is relatively straightforward, calibration drifts are more difficult to detect. Therefore, a detection and isolation technique for sensor calibration drifts on the purpose of measurement validation was developed. Temperature sensor measurements from the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system of a wind turbine were used for this aim. Low output rate of the measurements and nonlinear characteristics of the system drive the necessity to design an advanced fault detection algorithm. Artificial neural networks were chosen for this purpose considering their high performance in nonlinear environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively detect existence of calibration drift and isolate the exact sensor with faulty behaviour.

AB This paper presents an anomaly detection approach using machine learning to achieve condition monitoring for wind turbines. The approach applies the information in supervisory control and data acquisition systems as data input. First, machine learning is used to estimate the temperature signals of the gearbox component. Then the approach analyzes the deviations between the estimated values and the measurements of the signals. Finally, the information of alarm logs is integrated with the previous analysis to determine the operation states of wind turbines. The proposed approach has been tested with the data experience of a 2MW wind turbine in Sweden. The result demonstrates that the approach can detect possible anomalies before the failure occurrence. It also certifies that the approach can remind operators of the possible changes inside wind turbines even when the alarm logs do not report any alarms.

AB Prognostics and health management (PHM) is crucial in the lifecycle monitoring of a product, especially for complex equipment working in a harsh environment. In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of PHM, digital twin (DT), an emerging technology to achieve physical-virtual convergence, is proposed for complex equipment. A general DT for complex equipment is first constructed, then a new method using DT driven PHM is proposed, making effective use of the interaction mechanism and fused data of DT. A case study of a wind turbine is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of CIRP.

AB Wind turbines are a cost-effective alternative energy source; however, their blades are susceptible to damage. Therefore, damage detection of wind turbine blades is of great importance for condition monitoring of wind turbines. Many vibration-based structural damage detection techniques have been proposed in the last two decades. The local flexibility method, which can determine local stiffness variations of beam-like structures by using measured modal parameters, is one of the most promising vibration-based approaches. The local flexibility method does not require a finite element model of the structure. A few structural modal parameters identified from the ambient vibration signals both before and after damage are required for this method. In this study, we propose a damage detection approach for rotating wind turbine blades using the local flexibility method based on the dynamic macro-strain signals measured by long-gauge fiber Bragg grating (FBG)-based sensors. A small wind turbine structure was constructed and excited using a shaking table to generate vibration signals. The structure was designed to have natural frequencies as close as possible to those of a typical 1.5 MW wind turbine in real scale. The optical fiber signal of the rotating blades was transmitted to the data acquisition system through a rotary joint fixed inside the hollow shaft of the wind turbine. Reversible damage was simulated by aluminum plates attached to some sections of the wind turbine blades. The damaged locations of the rotating blades were successfully detected using the proposed approach, with the extent of damage somewhat over-estimated. Nevertheless, although the specimen of wind turbine blades cannot represent a real one, the results still manifest that FBG-based macro-strain measurement has potential to be employed to obtain the modal parameters of the rotating wind turbines and then locations of wind turbine segments with a change of rigidity can be estimated effectively by utilizing these identified parameters.

AB Wind turbines are, generally, placed at remote locations and are subject to harsh environmental conditions throughout their lifetimes. Consequently, major failures in wind turbines are expensive to repair and cause losses of revenue due to long down times. Asset management using optimal maintenance strategies can aid in improving the reliability and the availability of wind turbines, thereby making them more competitive. Various mathematical optimization models for maintenance scheduling have been developed for application with wind turbines. Typically, these models provide either an age based or a condition based preventive maintenance schedule. This paper proposes a wind turbine maintenance management framework which utilizes operation and maintenance data from different sources to combine the benefits of age based and condition based maintenance scheduling. A mathematical model called Preventive Maintenance Scheduling Problem with Interval Costs (PMSPIC) is presented with modification for the maintenance optimization considering both age based and condition based failure rate models. The application of the maintenance management framework is demonstrated with case studies which illustrate the advantage of the proposed approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS
AB The article proposes a method for diagnosing faults and cyberattacks in electric power generation units that consist of a wind-turbine and of an asynchronous (DFIG) generator. The method relies on a differential flatness theory-based implementation of the nonlinear Kalman Filter, known as Derivative-free nonlinear Kalman Filter. The estimated outputs provided by the Kalman filter are subtracted from the real outputs measured from the power unit, thus generating the residuals sequence. It is proven that the sum of the squares of the residuals vectors, weighted by the inverse of the residuals covariance matrix, stands for a stochastic variable that follows the chi(2) distribution. By exploiting the statistical properties of the chi(2) distribution one can define confidence intervals which allow for deciding at a high certainty level about the appearance of a fault or cyberattack in the wind-power system.

AB The traditional wind turbine fault monitoring is often based on a single monitoring signal without considering the overall correlation between signals. A global condition monitoring method based on Copula function and autoregressive neural network is proposed for this problem. Firstly, the Copula function was used to construct the binary joint probability density function of the power and wind speed in the fault-free state of the wind turbine. The function was used as the data fusion model to output the fusion data, and a fault-free condition monitoring model based on the auto-regressive neural network in the faultless state was established. The monitoring model makes a single-step prediction of wind speed and power, and statistical analysis of the residual values of the prediction determines whether the value is abnormal, and then establishes a fault warning mechanism. The experimental results show that this method can provide early warning and effectively realize the monitoring of wind turbine condition.

AB Reliability maintenance can be considered as an accurate condition monitoring system which increasing beneficial and decreasing the cost production of wind energy. Supporting low friction of wind turbine rotating shaft is the main task of rolling element bearing and it is the main part that suffers from failure. The rolling failures elements have an economic impact and may lead to malfunctions and catastrophic failures. This paper concentrates on the vibration monitoring as a Non-Destructive Technique for assessing and demonstrates the feasibility of vibration monitoring for small wind turbine bearing defects based on LabVIEW software. Many bearings defects were created, such as inner race defect, outer race defect, and ball spin defect. The spectra data were recorded and compared with the theoretical results. The accelerometer with 4331 NI USB DAQ was utilized to acquiring, analyzed, and recorded. The experimental results were showed the vibration technique is suitable for diagnostic the defects that will be occurred in the small wind turbine bearings and developing a fault in the bearing which leads to increasing the vibration amplitude or peaks in the spectrum.

ID TRENDS
AB This paper presents a cointegration-based method for condition monitoring and fault detection of wind turbines. The proposed method is based on the residual-based control chart approach. The main idea is that cointegration is a property of some sets of nonstationary time series where a linear combination of the nonstationary series can produce a stationary residual. Then the stationarity of cointegration residuals can be used in a control chart as a potentially effective damage feature. The method is validated using the experimental data acquired from a wind turbine drivetrain with a nominal power of 2 MW under varying environmental and operational conditions. Two known abnormal problems of the wind turbine are used to illustrate the fault detection ability of the method. A cointegration-based procedure is performed on six process parameters of the wind turbine where data trends have nonlinear characteristics. Analysis of cointegration residuals-obtained from cointegration process of wind turbine data-is used for operational condition monitoring and fault/abnormal detection. The results show that the proposed method can effectively monitor the wind turbine and reliably detect abnormal problems.

AB Wind turbines are designed to operate under varying conditions of speed and load. These rough operational conditions undermine conventional monitoring techniques and lead to unexpected failures of mechanical components. This work comes within the framework of wind turbine on-line condition monitoring. For this purpose, a particular attention was given to Instantaneous Angular Speed (IAS) emerging as a viable alternative to vibration analysis, especially in non stationary conditions. In this work, IAS signals were recorded from extensive measurement campaigns on different operating wind turbines. Suitable processing techniques have been specifically developed and allowed to analyze signals in healthy condition and in the presence of different bearing faults. Based on the latter, a huge number of expected relevant indicators was extracted. Different configurations of features transformation, selection and classification tools were tested. An optimized hybrid scheme has been designed. This approach allowed an optimal exploitation of IAS information and the construction of an effective tool for wind turbine condition monitoring.

AB In order to keep total life time costs of wind turbines competitive, the risk of failure has to be minimized, maintenance costs have to be reduced and energy efficiency needs to be increased. To achieve these goals, it is necessary to install efficient automated multi-sensor online monitoring and diagnose systems, so-called condition monitoring systems (CMS). The economic importance of these CMS systems has been increasingly recognized by wind farm operators, manufacturers and insurance companies. Thus, numerous CMS are already available on the market, however monitoring and fault detection is almost exclusively limited to the turbines drive train.
   Structural monitoring systems CMS, so called structural health monitoring systems (SHM) are currently only available to a very limited extent and are used almost exclusively in the research context. This applies especially to systems supervising wind turbines primary structural components such as the blades, tower and foundations.
   This paper explores the possibility of an alternative radar based monitoring technique which utilizes public broadcast transmissions to detect specific damage events remotely. Such a passive bistatic radar system (PBR) is capable of isolating and analyzing signal components of such transmissions, that have been scattered from objects within the environment such as the large scale structures from a wind turbine. This investigation aims to demonstrate that a PBR system is capable of extracting information about the wind turbines structural dynamic as a potential new class of SHM system. The presented results were obtained from measurement data taken with a prototype PBR, which is currently deployed within an on-shore wind farm.

AB Rolling element bearings are widely used in machinery, such as cooling fan, railway axle, centrifugal pump, transaction motor, gas turbine engine, wind turbine gearbox, etc., to support rotating shafts. Bearing failures will accelerate failures of other adjacent components and finally result in the breakdown of systems. To prevent any unexpected accidents and reduce economic loss, condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings should be immediately conducted. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) as an improvement on empirical mode decomposition is a data-driven algorithm to adaptively decompose vibration signals collected from the casing of machinery for bearing fault feature extraction without the requirement of expertise and thus its easy usage attracts much attention in recent years from readers and engineers. The direct applications of EEMD to preprocessing bearing fault signals for intelligent bearing fault diagnosis can be found in lots of publications and conferences every year. However, such applications are not always effective in extracting bearing fault features because the Fourier spectrum of the first intrinsic mode function is too wide and contains many unwanted strong low-frequency periodic components. In this paper, according to results from the analyses of industrial railway axle bearing fault signals, we experimentally show that the direct use of EEMD is not always effective in extracting bearing fault features. Further, to make EEMD more effective, we introduce the concept of blind fault component separation to separate low-frequency periodic vibration components from high-frequency random repetitive transients, such as bearing fault signals. Results show that the idea of blind fault component separation is much helpful in enhancing the effectiveness of EEMD in extracting bearing fault features in the case of industrial railway axle bearing fault diagnosis.

AB The pitch system playing a key role to capture wind energy is one of the most critical components of wind turbines (WTs). Meanwhile, it suffers the highest failure rate and major downtime. Improving the capacity of pitch system condition monitoring technique can effectively reduce operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data including comprehensive signal information from most subassemblies have been widely applied to condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of WTs. However, because of the complex operational condition of WTs, SCADA data become more complicated to study. This paper proposes a condition monitoring method of pitch system in multiple states based on blade angle-rotor speed-wind speed curve. In order to make the performance curve easier to explain, SCADA data are divided into nine parts according to the operational condition of WTs. Gaussian mixture model clustering, mean Euclidean distance and line fitting are applied to detect anomalies in three main states. Four faults in three categories have been study to demonstrate the feasibility of proposed method. It has been shown that the proposed condition monitoring method can not only simplify performance curves, but also detect pitch system faults effectively.

ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS
AB Wind turbines are being complex and critical systems. They encompass interacting mechanical and electrical systems subjected to variable aerodynamics and environmental conditions. Therefore, the use of single sensor to monitor and evaluate the performance and working condition of the system will not generate reliable results. To tackle this issue and to enhance the reliability of such system a multi-sensor (i.e. vibrations, torque, voltage and current) fusion system proposed in this paper to monitor the health condition of the wind turbine system. In time domain, both wind turbine vibration and the generated current increased by increasing the blade rotational speed. However, the overall vibration level is reduced by increasing the blade pitch angle. This could relate to the influence of increasing the air resistance, as more area of the blade will be in contact with the air, which plays the role of a damper. The developed air resistance reduce the rotational speed of the blade and consequently the generated current and voltage dropped. In frequency domain, the FFT power spectrum peaks are clearly indicates the influence of the rotational speed of different wind turbine rotating components on the generated frequency peaks. However, the peaks are very clear with less noise in the electrical signals compared with the vibrational signals. This gives a motivation to examine the application of the both vibrational and electrical signals for wind turbine condition monitoring and fault diagnostics.

AB Wind turbines usually operate under nonstationary conditions, such as wide-range speed fluctuation and time-varying load. Its critical component, the planetary gearbox, is prone to malfunction or failure, which leads to downtime and repair costs. Therefore, fault diagnosis and condition monitoring for the planetary gearbox in wind turbines is a vital research topic. Meanwhile, the signals measured by the vibration sensors mounted in the gearbox exhibit time-varying and nonstationary features. In this study, a novel time-frequency method based on high-order synchrosqueezing transform (SST) and multi-taper empirical wavelet transform (MTEWT) is proposed for the wind turbine planetary gearbox under nonstationary conditions. The high-order SST uses accurate instantaneous frequency approximations to obtain a sharper time-frequency representation (TFR). As the acquired signal consists of many components, like the meshing and rotating components of the gear and bearing, the fault component may be masked by other unrelated components. The MTEWT is used to separate the fault feature from the masking components. A variety of experimental signals of the wind turbine planetary gearbox under nonstationary conditions have been analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method is effective in diagnosing both gear and bearing faults.

DE Aerospace; Condition monitoring
AB Purpose - The purpose of this study was to perform a complete experimental assessment of a family of oil ferrous wear debris sensor is performed. The family comprised the original sensor and its re-engineered evolution, which is capable of detecting both amount and size of wear debris particles trapped by the sensor and some predefined oil condition properties.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this work, the first step was to perform a design of experiments for the sensor validation. A specially defined test rig was implemented, and different ferrous wear debris was collected. For each sensor, two different tests were performed. The first test was called a "void test", where quantified amounts of debris were collided with the sensor without oil. The second one was a dynamic test, where the sensor was installed in the test rig and different amounts of wear debris were added at a constant rate. In addition, specific tests related with oil properties detection were studied.
   Findings - The results show excellent correlation of the sensor output signal with the amount of wear debris and a satisfactory detection of debris size in all ranges. Also, the dynamic test presented adequate representativeness, and sensors performed well in this scenario.
   Practical implications - This paper shows the practical implementation of this type of sensor and the usual detection range and rate of detection for different debris size and quantities.
   Originality/value - This work has a great utility for maintenance managers and equipment designers to fully understand the potential of this type of sensor and its suitability for the application required.

AB Renewable energy from wind and solar is considered to be the main alternative to fossil fuels. The costs of renewable energy technologies are high and without tax credits they are not currently competitive with fossil fuels in many markets. Improvements in the performance or reduction in operational costs will have significant impacts on the price of renewable energy and ultimately impact their competitiveness. New technologies targeted at improving the efficiency of the current systems or reducing their life-cycle costs will help; however, these technologies are expensive and detailed cost tradeoff and return on investment (ROI) analysis are required to make business cases for them. In this paper, we formulate an ROI model and describe its implementation in a stochastic discrete-event simulator to calculate financial tradeoffs and enable business cases for technology insertion into wind farms. The new ROI model includes changes in revenue and operations costs (including changes in reliability due to the technology insertion) and introduces the concept of identical timeline conditions to guarantee a meaningful ROI calculation. A case study for using light detection and ranging (LIDAR) to increase the efficiency and improve the reliability of wind turbines in a wind farm is provided.

AB The blades icing accretion detection of wind turbines is a quite challenge problem in wind energy industry. One of the fair important aspects is that wind turbines work on the varying condition, in which the wind speed changes a lot. In this paper, the feasibility of it based on the power-related data, wind data, and temperature data in the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is investigated. A deep neural network (DNN)-based framework is proposed to monitor the health condition of wind turbines. The core of it is that the discriminative deep feature representation is learned by taking multiple operation stages of wind turbines into consideration in the network structure, such as the stage of maximal power point tracking, the stage of constant rotating speed, the stage of rated power output, and so on, which handles two problems well, i.e., the data imbalance problem and high degree of feature variability in original SCADA data. The optimization goal of the proposed DNN is the triplet-header hinge loss. It preserves locality across operation stages and discrimination between different health conditions. The effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method is demonstrated by the SCADA data of three wind turbines from one wind farm in north China. The results show that the proposed DNN outperforms the traditional method named normal behavior modeling based on artificial neural network.

AB An effective use of faulty-state data is proposed to achieve robust, accurate data-driven anomaly (fault) detection for rotating machine. Although using faulty data in the training process generally can improve the performance of anomaly detection system, it is rare to obtain enough samples to train failures or defects on a target machine. We therefore utilize the existing data from non-target (different-type) machines for feature representation learning to improve anomaly detection for the target machine. Specifically, deep neural networks (DNNs) that are trained to discriminate the normal and faulty states of the non-target machines are used to extract features. The extracted features are then taken as inputs to an anomaly detector based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). This architecture is called DNN/GMM tandem connectionist anomaly detection. Experimental comparisons using vibration signals from actual wind turbine components demonstrated that the developed tandem connectionist system yielded significant improvements over existing systems, and that the representation learning performed robustly with respect to differences in machine types.

AB Due to the strong growth of wind power in the energy mix and the intense development of higher-power wind turbines, reducing the operating and maintenance costs has become a crucial aspect nowadays to guarantee the security of electricity supply. Condition monitoring plays a key role in achieving this goal. Today most monitoring strategies for converters focus on monitoring the electrical parameters of the converter and on temperature monitoring of the insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) in a direct or more indirect way. This paper proposes an alternative approach. Vibration measurements performed on the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) connected to the converter are used to detect the converter IGBT problems. We focus on the open-switch fault in the rotor side converter (RSC) to illustrate this concept. Spectral analysis is done on the measured vibrations to detect this type of faults. First, the approach is illustrated by means of a simulation model representing a 3 kW DFIG wind turbine test bench. In a second step, the approach is validated on the corresponding bench. A differentiation is made between sub-synchronous and super-synchronous rotation speeds. The ability of the method to detect the fault in both conditions is shown.

TI Diagnosing and Predicting Wind Turbine Faults from SCADA Data Using

DT Article
AB Unscheduled or reactive maintenance on wind turbines due to component failure incurs significant downtime and, in turn, loss of revenue. To this end, it is important to be able to perform maintenance before it's needed. To date, a strong effort has been applied to developing Condition Monitoring Systems (CMSs) which rely on retrofitting expensive vibration or oil analysis sensors to the turbine. Instead, by performing complex analysis of existing data from the turbine's Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, valuable insights into turbine performance can be obtained at a much lower cost.
   In this paper, fault and alarm data from a turbine on the Southern coast of Ireland is analysed to identify periods of nominal and faulty operation. Classification techniques are then applied to detect and diagnose faults by taking into account other SCADA data such as temperature, pitch and rotor data. This is then extended to allow prediction and diagnosis in advance of specific faults. Results are provided which show recall scores generally above 80% for fault detection and diagnosis, and prediction up to 24 hours in advance of specific faults, representing significant improvement over previous techniques.

TI Performance Assessment of a Wind Turbine Using SCADA based Gaussian
   Process Model
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Loss of wind turbine power production identified through performance assessment is a useful tool for effective condition monitoring of a wind turbine. Power curves describe the nonlinear relationship between power generation and hub height wind speed and play a significant role in analyzing the performance of a turbine.
   Performance assessment using nonparametric models is gaining popularity. A Gaussian Process is a nonlinear, nonparametric probabilistic approach widely used for fitting models and forecasting applications due to its flexibility and mathematical simplicity. Its applications extended to both classification and regression related problems. Despite promising results, Gaussian Process application in wind turbine condition monitoring is limited.
   In this paper, a model based on a Gaussian Process developed for assessing the performance of a turbine. Here, a reference power curve using SCADA datasets from a healthy turbine is developed using a Gaussian Process and then was compared with a power curve from an unhealthy turbine. Error due to yaw misalignment is a standard issue with a wind turbine, which causes underperformance. Hence it is used as case study to test and validate the algorithm effectiveness.

AB Wind turbine blade condition monitoring is necessary for planning blade maintenance. In this paper, a wind turbine blade condition monitoring and damage detection based on vibration measurement using a image-based system is proposed. Blade are measured in undamaged and damaged conditions under various vibration frequencies and displacement amplitudes. The results were compared and analysed in both time and frequency domains. Then a frequency-based index is proposed to quantify the vibration dynamics and detect the damage.

AB A novel data-driven deep-learning system for large-scale wind turbine drivetrain monitoring applications is presented. It uses convolutional neural network processing on complex vibration signal inputs. The system is demonstrated to learn successfully from the actions of human diagnostic experts and provide early and robust fault detection on both rotor bearing, planetary and helical stage gear box bearings from analysis of multisensor vibration patterns using only a high-level feature selection. On the basis of data from 251 actual wind turbine bearing failures, we are able to accurately quantify the fleet-wide diagnostic model performance. The analysis also explores the time dependence of the diagnostic performance, providing a detailed view of the timeliness and accuracy of the diagnostic outputs across the different architectures. Deep architectures are shown to outperform the human analyst as well as shallow-learning architectures, and the results demonstrate that when applied in a large-scale monitoring system, machine intelligence is now able to handle some of the most challenging diagnostic tasks related to wind turbines.

   indicators; vibration measurements; wind turbine
ID DIAGNOSTICS
AB Bearings are typically used in wind turbines to support shafts and gears that increase rotational speed from a low speed rotor to a higher speed electrical generator. For various bearing applications, condition monitoring using vibration measurements has remained a subject of intense study to the present day since several decades. Various signal processing techniques are used to analyse vibration signals and extract features related to defects. Statistical indicators such as Crest Factor (CF) and Kurtosis (KU) were reported as very sensitive indicators when the presence of the defects is pronounced, whilst their values may come down to the level of undamaged components when the damage is well advanced. Further, these indicators were applied to an acquired data from proposed diagnostic models, test rigs, and instrumentations that were specifically used for particular research tests, and thus, it is essential to undertake further investigations and analysis to assess the influence of other factors such as the structural noise and other operating conditions on the real-world applications. With this in mind, the present work proposes Signal Intensity Estimator (SIE) as a new technique to discriminate individual types of early natural damage in real-world wind turbine bearings. Comparative results between SIE and conventional indicators such as KU and CF are also presented. It was concluded that SIE has an advantage over the other fault indicators if sufficient data are provided.

ID SYSTEMS
AB To monitor wind turbine vibrations, normal behaviour models are built to predict tower top accelerations and drive-train vibrations. Signal deviations from model prediction are labelled as anomalies and are further investigated. In this paper we assess a stochastic approach to reconstruct the 1 Hz tower top acceleration signal, which was measured in a wind turbine located at the wind farm Alpha Ventus in the German North Sea. We compare the resulting data reconstruction with that of a model based on a neural network, which has been previously reported as a data-mining algorithm suitable for reconstructing this signal. Our results present evidence that the stochastic approach outperforms the neural network in the high frequency domain (1 Hz). Although neural network retrieves accurate step-forward predictions, with low mean square errors, the stochastic approach predictions better preserve the statistics and the frequency components of the original signal, retaining high accuracy levels. The implementation of our stochastic approach is available as open source code and can easily be adapted for other situations involving stochastic data reconstruction. Based on our findings we argue that such an approach could be implemented in signal reconstruction for monitoring purposes or for abnormal behaviour detection.

AB A wind turbine is a very well-known archetype of energy conversion system working at non-stationary regimes. Despite this, a deep mechanical comprehension of wind turbines operating in complicated conditions is still challenging, especially as regards the analysis of experimental data. In particular, wind turbines in complex terrain represent a very valuable testing ground because of the possible combination of wake effects among nearby turbines and flow accelerations caused by the terrain morphology. For these reasons, in this work, a cluster of four full-scale wind turbines from a very complex site is studied. The object of investigation is vibrations, at the level of the structure (tower) and drive-train. Data collected by the on-board condition monitoring system are analyzed and interpreted in light of the knowledge of wind conditions and operating parameters collected by the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA). A free flow Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation is also performed, and it allows one to better interpret the vibration analysis. The main outcome is the interpretation of how wakes and flow turbulences appear in the vibration signals, both at the structural level and at the drive-train level. Therefore, this wind to gear approach builds a connection between flow phenomena and mechanical phenomena in the form of vibrations, representing a precious tool for assessing loads in different working conditions.

ID EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION
AB The idea of indicative fault diagnosis based on measuring the wind turbine tower sound and vibration is presented. It had been reported by a wind farm operator that a major fault on the generator bearing causes shock and noise to be heard from the bottom of the wind turbine tower. The work in this paper was conceived to test whether tower top faults could be identified by taking simple measurements at the tower base. Two accelerometers were attached inside the wind turbine tower, and vibration data was collected while the wind turbine was in operation. Tower vibration signals were analyzed using Empirical Mode Decomposition and the outcomes were correlated with the vibration signals acquired directly from the generator bearings. It is shown that the generator bearing fault signatures were present in the vibrations from the tower. The results suggest that useful condition monitoring of nacelle components can be done even when there is no condition monitoring system installed on the generator bearings, as is often the case for older wind turbines. In the second part of the paper, acoustic measurements from a healthy and a faulty wind turbine are shown. The preliminary analysis suggests that the generator bearing fault increases the overall sound pressure level at the bottom of the tower, and is not buried in the background noise.

AB The wind turbine gearbox, an important component of wind turbines, has a high failure rate and maintenance cost; therefore, several vibration sensors are installed to execute effective condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, and prediction, for reducing the downtime caused by faults. The sensor positions should directly and accurately reflect the gearbox operating status and provide several signals to the condition monitoring system. This article studies a gearbox model and the gear tooth faults, and builds a gearbox gear vibration model involving these faults. Using structure analysis, sensor configuration solutions rendering all the tooth faults detectable and all the faults isolable are, respectively, obtained, based on the gear vibration model. The sensor configuration solutions of the wind turbine gearbox can guide wind turbine gearbox sensor installation in practice and support common wind turbine gearbox sensor configuration solutions in theory.

AB Condition monitoring (CM) is used to assess the health status of wind turbines (WT) by detecting turbine failure and predicting maintenance needs. However, fluctuating operating conditions cause variations in monitored features, therefore increasing the difficulty of CM, for example, the frequency-domain analysis may lead to an inaccurate or even incorrect prediction when evaluating the health of the WT components. In light of this challenge, this paper proposed a method for the health evaluation of WT components based on vibration signals. The proposed approach aimed to reduce the evaluation error caused by the impact of the variable operating condition. First, the vibration signal was decomposed into a set of sub-signals using variational mode decomposition (VMD). Next, the sub-signal energy and the probability distribution were obtained and normalized. Finally, the concept of entropy was introduced to evaluate the health condition of a monitored object to provide an effective guide for maintenance. In particular, the health evaluation for CM was based on a performance review over a range of operating conditions, rather than at a certain single operating condition. Experimental investigations were performed which verified the efficiency of the evaluation method, as well as a comparison with the previous method.

AB This paper proposes new seismic-based methods for use in the wind energy industry with a focus on wind turbine condition monitoring. Fourteen Streckeisen STS-2 Broadband seismometers and two three-dimensional (3D) sonic anemometers are deployed in/near an operating wind farm to collect the data used in these proof-of-principle analyses. The interquartile mean (IQM) value of power spectral density (PSD) of the seismic components in 10 min time series is used to characterize the spectral signatures (i.e., frequencies with enhanced variance) in ground vibrations deriving from vibrations of wind turbine subassemblies. A power spectral envelope approach is taken in which the probability density function (PDF) of seismic PSD is developed using seismic data collected under normal turbine operation. These power spectral envelopes clearly show the energy distribution of wind-turbine-induced ground vibrations over a wide frequency range. Singular PSD lying outside the power spectral envelopes can be easily identified and is used herein along with supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data to diagnose the associated suboptimal turbine operating conditions. Illustrative examples are given herein for periods with yaw misalignment and excess tower acceleration. It is additionally shown that there is a strong association between drivetrain acceleration and seismic spectral power in a frequency band of 2.5-12.5 Hz. The long-term goal of the research is development of seismic-based condition monitoring (SBCM) for wind turbines. The primary advantages of SBCM are that the approach is low-cost, noninvasive, and versatile (i.e., one seismic sensor monitoring multiple turbine components).

AB Wind turbines are growing rapidly in size and diameter. Nowadays, most wind turbines being installed are around 100 m in height and 80-120 m in diameter. Another important characteristic of wind farms is that they are usually far from urban centers. These peculiarities play an important role when analyzing the operation and maintenance costs and its impact in the wind farm project. In remote centers, it becomes crucial to predict and prevent unnecessary maintenance breakdowns and costs. An efficient solution to prevent faults on wind turbines is through condition monitoring. Faults could be prevented by analyzing data from sensors placed around the wind turbines to measure mainly oil quality, temperature, and vibration. In this paper, accelerometers were placed on the main components of a real wind turbine and a vibration-based condition monitoring methodology was applied using signal processing techniques such as Fourier transform, and envelope analysis with Hilbert transform. A bearing fault was discovered and the vibration characteristics were analyzed before and after the bearing replacement.

AB Condition Monitoring (CM) has been considered as an effective method to enhance the reliability of wind turbines and implement cost-effective maintenance. Thus, adopting an efficient approach for condition monitoring of wind turbines is desirable. This paper presents a data-driven model-based CM approach for wind turbines based on the online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) algorithm. A physical kinetic energy correction model is employed to normalize the temperature change to the value at the rated power output to eliminate the effect of variable speed operation of the turbines. The residual signal, obtained by comparing the predicted values and practical measurements, is processed by the physical correction model and then assessed with a Bonferroni interval method for fault diagnosis. Models have been validated using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data acquired from an operational wind farm, which contains various types of temperature data of the gearbox. The results show that the proposed method can detect more efficiently both the long-term aging characteristics and the short-term faults of the gearbox.

AB In this article, a parametric model for health condition monitoring of wind turbines is developed. The study is based on the assumption that a wind turbine's health condition can be modeled through three features: rotor speed, gearbox temperature and generator winding temperature. At first, three neural network models are created to simulate normal behavior of each feature. Deviation signals are then defined and calculated as accumulated time-series of differences between neural network predictions and actual measurements. These cumulative signals carry health condition-related information. Next, through nonlinear regression technique, the signals are used to produce individual models for considered features, which mathematically have the form of proportional hazard models. Finally, they are combined to construct an overall parametric health condition model which partially represents health condition of the wind turbine. In addition, a dynamic threshold for the model is developed to facilitate and add more insight in performance monitoring aspect. The health condition monitoring of wind turbine model has capability of evaluating real-time and overall health condition of a wind turbine which can also be used with regard to maintenance in electricity generation in electric power systems. The model also has flexibility to overcome current challenges such as scalability and adaptability. The model is verified in illustrating changes in real-time and overall health condition with respect to considered anomalies by testing through actual and artificial data.

AB In recent years, global wind power capacity has grown steadily at an annual rate of around 20%. This has led to wind energy becoming the most important renewable energy source on a global scale, with the total installed capacity reaching 430 GW. However, the strong growth of offshore wind power has been somewhat inhibited due to a number of operational challenges that are yet to be addressed in full. The most important of these challenges appears to be the reliability of the wind turbine gearbox (WTG). WTGs are currently unable to survive their anticipated design lifetime of 20-25 years. Most of them hardly reach a useful operational lifetime of more than seven years without serious refurbishment or replacement and, for offshore wind turbines, failures have been reported as early as within one to two years. In this paper, the damage mechanisms influencing WTGs supported by finite element analysis have been considered and presented in the context of condition monitoring diagnosis and prognosis.

AB Cases of excessive vertical displacement of wind turbines with inserted can foundations have been reported worldwide. Crack occurrence and propagation are among the critical factors that can reduce a turbine's capacity and alter its dynamic response. This paper reports on the use of a combination of two approaches to determine the nature of the defects around the bottom flange of an inserted can. A discrete strain monitoring system that used arrays of sparsely spaced sensors was used to capture the occurrence of cracks and monitor the crack-opening displacement pattern. Ultrasonic testing was adopted to locate defects and identify the approximate boundaries of cracks under the bottom of the inserted can. Two onshore 1.5 MW wind turbine foundations in northern China were selected to evaluate the performance of these monitoring approaches and improve understanding of foundation responses during construction and operation. The monitoring strategies were proven capable of capturing the occurrence and the change of cracks in a full-scale test. Results suggest that cracks in onshore turbine foundations would occur at an early age, grow gradually and fluctuate according to wind speed changes. Long-term monitoring of crack development will be required to ensure foundation integrity.

AB Major failures in wind turbines are expensive to repair and cause loss of revenue due to long downtime. Condition-based maintenance, which provides a possibility to reduce maintenance cost, has been made possible because of the successful application of various condition monitoring systems in wind turbines. New methods to improve the condition monitoring system are continuously being developed. Monitoring based on data stored in the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system in wind turbines has received attention recently. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have proved to be a powerful tool for SCADA-based condition monitoring applications. This paper first gives an overview of the most important publications that discuss the application of ANN for condition monitoring in wind turbines. The knowledge from these publications is utilized and developed further with a focus on two areas: the data preprocessing and the data post-processing. Methods for filtering of data are presented, which ensure that the ANN models are trained on the data representing the true normal operating conditions of the wind turbine. A method to overcome the errors from the ANN models due to discontinuity in SCADA data is presented. Furthermore, a method utilizing the Mahalanobis distance is presented, which improves the anomaly detection by considering the correlation between ANN model errors and the operating condition. Finally, the proposed method is applied to case studies with failures in wind turbine gearboxes. The results of the application illustrate the advantages and limitations of the proposed method.

AB This paper proposes a condition monitoring technique using current signature analysis for diagnosis of Rotor eccentricity fault in Squirrel cage induction generators used in wind power systems. The proposed method measures the current characteristic frequencies of the excitations generated by a Wind turbine generator. The excitations generated by wind turbine generator eccentricity fault are extracted and analyzed under no load, full load and varying wind conditions. Side bands are calculated using FFT approach. Fault frequencies are further analyzed using wavelet-based analysis for steady state and dynamic conditions. Multi-resolution mean power indicator has been used for the quantification of the fault. It has been experimentally proven that for varying wind conditions wavelet decomposition allows good differentiation between faulty and healthy conditions leading to an effectual diagnostic procedure for condition monitoring.

ID EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; GENERATOR
AB Condition monitoring (CM) is considered an effective method to improve the reliability of wind turbines (WTs) and implement cost-effective maintenance. This study presents a single hidden-layer feedforward neural network (SLFN), trained using an extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm, for CM of WTs. Gradient-based algorithms are commonly used to train SLFNs; however, these algorithms are slow and may become trapped in local optima. The use of an ELM algorithm can dramatically reduce learning time and overcome issues associated with local optima. In this study, the ELM model is optimised using a genetic algorithm. The residual signal obtained by comparing the model and actual output is analysed using the Mahalanobis distance (MD) measure due to its ability to capture correlations among multiple variables. An accumulated MD value, obtained from a range of components, is used to evaluate the health of a gearbox, one of the critical subsystems of a WT. Models have been identified from supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data obtained from a working wind farm. The results show that the proposed training method is considerably faster than traditional techniques, and the proposed method can efficiently identify faults and the health condition of the gearbox in WTs.

AB Feature extraction from nonlinear and non-stationary (NNS) wind turbine (WT) condition monitoring (CM) signals is challenging. Previously, much effort has been spent to develop advanced signal processing techniques for dealing with CM signals of this kind. The Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) is one of the achievements attributed to these efforts. The EWT takes advantage of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) in dealing with NNS signals but is superior to the EMD in mode decomposition and robustness against noise. However, the conventional EWT meets difficulty in properly segmenting the frequency spectrum of the signal, especially when lacking pre-knowledge of the signal. The inappropriate segmentation of the signal spectrum will inevitably lower the accuracy of the EWT result and thus raise the difficulty of WT CM. To address this issue, an enhanced EWT is proposed in this paper by developing a feasible and efficient spectrum segmentation method. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified by using the bearing and gearbox CM data that are open to the public for the purpose of research. The experiment has shown that, after adopting the proposed method, it becomes much easier and more reliable to segment the frequency spectrum of the signal. Moreover, benefitting from the correct segmentation of the signal spectrum, the fault-related features of the CM signals are presented more explicitly in the time-frequency map of the enhanced EWT, despite the considerable noise contained in the signal and the shortage of pre-knowledge about the machine being investigated.

AB Condition monitoring has been widely used to detect mechanical and electrical faults of wind turbine in order to avoid any potential catastrophic failures, reduce operational and maintenance cost, and enhance the reliability and availability of the equipment. Although several papers about wind turbine condition monitoring can be found in the literatures, adopting a reliable and cost-effective technique for wind turbines that usually experience severe mechanical stress due to the harsh weather conditions they are exposed to is still challenging. Although statistical studies show that gearbox failure rate is low, the resulted downtime and the replacement or repairing cost is substantial. This study introduces an improved technique to monitor the condition of the wind turbine gearbox based on gearbox vibration and shaft torque signatures analyses. In this context, a test rig that emulates real wind turbine operation has been developed to analyse the behaviour of wind turbine under various mechanical fault levels. Shaft torque and mechanical vibration signals are detected using high-resolution sensors and are analysed using two signal processing techniques: wavelet and order analyses to examine the impact of investigated fault levels on the wind turbine drive train. Both signal processing techniques are compared based on their sensitivity to detect incipient fault levels.

AB Lifetime evaluation with fatigue loads is commonly used in the design phase of wind turbines, but rarely during operation due to the cost of extra measurements. Fatigue load prediction with neural networks, using existing SCADA signals, is a potential cost-effective alternative to continuously monitor lifetime consumption. However, although assessments for turbines in wind farm flow have been pointed out as deficient, the evaluations were limited to single cases and the implication for the design of a monitoring system was not discussed. Hence, we proposed metrics to evaluate prediction quality and, using one year of measurements at two wind turbines, we evaluated predictions in six different flow conditions. The quality of fatigue load predictions were evaluated for bending moments of two blades, in edgewise and flapwise directions. Results, based on 48 analyses, demonstrated that prediction quality varies marginally with varying flow conditions. Predictions were accurate in all cases and had an average error below 1.5%, but their precision slightly deteriorated in wake flow conditions. In general, results demonstrated that a reasonable monitoring system can be based on a neural network model without the need to distinguish between inflow conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Rotor bearing systems (RBSs) play a very valuable role for wind turbine gearboxes, aero - engines, high speed spindles, and other rotational machinery. An in depth understanding of vibrations of the RBSs is very useful for condition monitoring and diagnosis applications of these machines. A new twelve- degree -of -freedom dynamic model for rigid RBSs with a localized defect (LOD) is proposed. This model can formulate the housing support stiffness, interfacial frictional moments including load dependent and load independent components, time-varying displacement excitation caused by a LOD, additional deformations at the sharp edges of the LOD, and lubricating oil film. The time-varying displacement model is determined by a half-sine function. A new method for calculating the additional deformations at the sharp edges of the LOD is analytical derived based on an elastic quarter -space method presented in the literature. The proposed dynamic model is utilized to analyze the influences of the housing support stiffness and LOD sizes on the vibration characteristics of the rigid RBS, which cannot be predicted by the previous dynamic models in the literature. The results show that the presented method can give a new dynamic modeling method for vibration formulation for a rigid RBS with and without the LOD on the races. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The feasibility of monitoring the health of wind turbine (WT) gearboxes based on the lubricant pressure data in the supervisory control and data acquisition system is investigated in this paper. A deep neural network (DNN)-based framework is developed to monitor conditions of WT gearboxes and identify their impending failures. Six data-mining algorithms, the k-nearest neighbors, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, ridge regression (Ridge), support vector machines, shallow neural network, as well as DNN, are applied to model the lubricant pressure. A comparative analysis of developed data-driven models is conducted and the DNN model is the most accurate. To prevent the overfitting of the DNN model, a dropout algorithm is applied into the DNN training process. Computational results show that the prediction error will shift before the occurrences of gearbox failures. An exponentially weighted moving average control chart is deployed to derive criteria for detecting the shifts. The effectiveness of the proposed monitoring approach is demonstrated by examining real cases from wind farms in China and bench-marked against the gearbox monitoring based on the oil temperature data.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based condition monitoring approach of a wind turbine using Simulink, FAST (fatigue, aerodynamics, structures and turbulence) and TurbSim is presented. The complete dynamics of a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based wind turbine [i.e. wind turbine generator (WTG)] model is simulated in an amalgamated domain of Simulink, FAST and TurbSim under six distinct conditions, i.e. aerodynamic asymmetry, rotor-furl imbalance, tail-furl imbalance, blade imbalance, nacelle-yaw imbalance and normal operating scenarios. The simulation results in time domain of the PMSG output stator current are decomposed into the intrinsic mode functions using EMD method then RapidMiner-based principal component analysis method is used to select most relevant input variables. An ANN model is then proposed to differentiate the normal operating scenarios from five fault conditions. The analysed results proclaim the effectiveness of the proposed approach to identify the different imbalance faults in WTG. The presented work renders initial results that are helpful for online condition monitoring and health assessment of WTG.

AB As core components of wind power equipment, wind turbine gearboxes usually work in hostile conditions, which accounts for the increasing failure rate year by year. Therefore, the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis play a vital role in the safe operation of wind power gearboxes. Compared with ordinary gear train, wind power gearboxes have more complex transfer systems. Moreover, the vibration combination generated by multi-gears meshing and time-variant transfer paths of vibration signals increases the difficulty of wind turbine gearboxes fault diagnosis. To accurately detect the faults and analyze the fault signal transfer mechanism of planetary gearboxes, this article proposes a novel method based on power flow finite element to study transfer paths. For localized spalling of planetary gears, this article analyzes six transfer paths' contributions of the fault signal and carries on the finite element analysis to determine the dominant transfer path. By contrast, the proposed method overcomes the problems of mutual coherence and time variance requested for traditional transfer path analysis methods and reveals the changes of energy and attenuation law. The detection of dominant transfer path will greatly promote the reveal of failure mechanism and fault feature extraction for wind turbine gearboxes, which has significant academic and engineering value.

TI Prediction of Wear in Grouted Connections for Offshore Wind Turbine

DT Article

   development; Wind turbines
ID SPEED; STRENGTH; BEHAVIOR
AB Insufficient axial capacity of large-diameter plain-pipe grouted connections has recently been observed in offshore wind turbine substructures across Europe. Aimed at understanding the implications of this phenomenon, a campaign of structural condition monitoring was undertaken. The measurements showed significant axial displacements occurring between the transition piece and the monopile, which in turn resulted in a considerable amount of wear. Given the existing lack of technical data on the implications that this relative movement has on the wear of grouted connections, a methodology was developed to quantify the likely risk to the foundation integrity of the wear failure mode. The proposed approach consists of a numerical model which applies the wear rate derived from previous experimental testing to the conditions experienced by typical offshore grouted connections, as indicated by the wind turbine generators' supervisory control and data acquisition systems. The output of this model showed that, for a representative sample of the wind farm substructures analysed as a case study, the accumulated lifetime wear would be minimal in the majority of the grouted connection, i. e. less than 0.4 mm over 75% of the connection, but a much greater loss in thickness, of the order of 4 mm, was predicted at the very top and bottom of the connection. This assessment is based on the assumptions that no significant changes occur in the surrounding environmental conditions and that the degradation in the grouted connection does not significantly affect the dynamic response of the foundation structure over its life span. Importantly, these assumptions may affect themodel's predictions in terms of cumulatedwear over time, not in terms of identifying the individual connections to be prioritised when performing remedial work, which is indeed the main intended use of the model.

AB To optimally plan maintenance of wind turbine blades, knowledge of the degradation processes and the remaining useful life is essential. In this paper, a method is proposed for calibration of a Markov deterioration model based on past inspection data for a range of blades, and updating of the model for a specific wind turbine blade, whenever information is available from inspections and/or condition monitoring. Dynamic Bayesian networks are used to obtain probabilities of inspection outcomes for a maximum likelihood estimation of the transition probabilities in the Markov model, and are used again when updating the model for a specific blade using observations. The method is illustrated using indicative data from a database containing data from inspections of wind turbine blades.

AB On-line condition monitoring is of paramount importance for multilevel power converters used in safety-critical applications. A novel on-line nonintrusive diagnostic method for detecting open-circuit switch faults in silicon carbide (SiC) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs)based T-type multilevel converters is introduced in this paper. The principle of this method is based on monitoring the abnormal variations of the dc-bus neutral-point current in combination with the existing information on instantaneous switching states and phase currents. Advantages of this method include faster detection speed and simpler implementation compared to other existing diagnostic methods in the literature. Moreover, this diagnostic method is immune to the disturbances of inverter's dc-bus voltage unbalance and load unbalance. In this method, only one additional current sensor is required for measuring the dc-bus neutral-point current; therefore, the implementation cost is low. Simulation and experimental results based on a lab-scale 20 kVA adjustable speed drive with a three-level SiC T-type inverter validate the effectiveness and robustness of this novel diagnostic method.

AB The past decade has seen exponential yearly growth in installed capacity wind energy power generation. As a result, wind farm (WF) projects have evolved from small scale isolated installations into complex utility scale power generation systems comprising of arrays of large wind turbines (WTs), which are designed to operate in harsh environments. However, this has increased the need for through-life engineering service (TES) for WTs especially in offshore applications, where the operations and maintenance (O&M) becomes more complicated as a result of the harsh marine weather and environmental conditions. In this paper, a generic methodology to benchmark TES in industries is presented and used to assess TES in the wind industry. This was done by identifying the current state-ofthe- art in methods and applications, requirements and needs, challenges, and opportunities of TES in the wind sector. Furthermore an illustrative case study on WT gearbox through-life support is presented demonstrating how some of the core aspects, such as remote condition monitoring, can be used to aid the in-service support of wind turbine gearboxes.

DE Couplings; Shaft misalignment; Condition monitoring; Temperature
AB Temperature is a parameter increasingly monitored in wind turbine systems. This paper details a potential temperature monitoring technique for use on shaft couplings. Such condition monitoring methods aid fault detection in other areas of wind turbines. However, application to shaft couplings has not previously been widely researched.
   A novel temperature measurement technique is outlined, using an infra-red thermometer which can be applied to online condition monitoring. The method was validated and investigated through real time shaft alignment tests. Different modes of misalignment including offset and angular were investigated. This allowed analysis of the relationship between a change in shaft alignment and a change in temperature. The rate of change was found to be a factor of condition through exploring changes in ambient and operating temperatures. The test rig allowed quantification on a small scale and potential causes and effects of temperature changes are discussed. (C) 2016 The Authors.

ID SCADA DATA
AB We demonstrate how flexible non-linear models can provide accurate and robust predictions on turbine component temperature sensor data using data-driven principles and only a minimum of system modeling. The merits of different model architectures are evaluated using data from a large set of turbines operating under diverse conditions. We then go on to test the predictive models in a diagnostic setting, where the output of the models are used to detect mechanical faults in rotor bearings. Using retrospective data from 22 actual rotor bearing failures, the fault detection performance of the models are quantified using a structured framework that provides the metrics required for evaluating the performance in a fleet wide monitoring setup. It is demonstrated that faults are identified with high accuracy up to 45days before a warning from the hard-threshold warning system. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Detection and classification of faults in pitch-regulated wind turbine
   generators using normal behaviour models based on performance curves
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Condition monitoring; Wind turbine generator; Pitch faults; Performance
   curves; Normal behaviour model
AB The fast growing wind industry requires a more sophisticated fault detection approach in pitch-regulated wind turbine generators (WTG), particularly in the pitch system that has led to the highest failure frequency and downtime. Improved analysis of data from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems can be used to generate alarms and signals that could provide earlier indication of WTG faults and allow operators to more effectively plan Operation and Maintenance (O&M) strategies prior to WTG failures. Several data-mining approaches, e.g. Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Normal Behaviour Models (NBM) have been used for that purpose. However, practical applications are limited because of the SCADA data complexity and the lack of accuracy due to the use of SCADA data averaged over a period of 10 min for ANN training. This paper aims to propose a new pitch fault detection procedure using performance curve (PC) based NBMs. An advantage of the proposed approach is that the system consisting of NBMs and criteria, can be developed using technical specifications of studied WTGs. A second advantage is that training data is unnecessary prior to application of the system. In order to construct the proposed system, details of WTG operational states and PCs are studied. Power-generator speed (P-N) and pitch angle-generator speed (PA-N) curves are selected to set up NBMs due to the better fit between the measured data and theoretical PCs. Six case studies have been carried out to show the prognosis of WTG fault and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. The results illustrate that polluted slip rings and the pitch controller malfunctions could be detected by the proposed method 20 h and 13 h earlier than by the Al approaches investigated and the existing alarm system. In addition, the proposed approach is able to explain and visualize abnormal behaviour of WTGs during the fault conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although wind turbine gearboxes are designed to remain in service for 20-25 years, this is not normally the case due to defects initiating and developing prematurely. A large number of gearboxes fail after seven to eight years in service. In offshore wind farms, gearbox failures have been reported after only one to two years in service, leading to noteworthy production losses. Reliability issues associated with wind turbine gearboxes are yet to be resolved. Within this paper, the quality of materials used for manufacturing wind turbine gearbox gears and bearings has been evaluated. The damage mechanisms affecting gearbox materials have been investigated based on metallographic analysis carried out on failed samples removed from in-service industrial wind turbines. Finite element analysis (FEA) has been carried out in order to simulate damage initiation and propagation under in-service conditions. The results have been compared with the experimental observations made on the failed field samples and have been found to be in good agreement. The applicability of acoustic emission in detecting and identifying defects in different wind turbine gearbox components remotely has been assessed following measurements in the field.

AB This paper proposes an approach for stress condition monitoring and maintenance assessment in wind turbines (WTs) through large amounts of collected data from the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The objectives of the proposed approach are to provide a stress condition model for health monitoring, to assess the WT's maintenance strategies, and to provide recommendations on current maintenance schemes for future operations of the wind farm. At first, several statistical techniques, namely principal component analysis, Pearson, Spearman and Kendall correlations, mutual information, regressional ReliefF and decision trees are used and compared to assess the data for dimensionality reduction and parameter selection. Next, a normal behavior model is constructed by an artificial neural network which performs condition monitoring analysis. Then, a model based on the mathematical form of a proportional hazards model is developed where it represents the stress condition of the WT. Finally, those two models are jointly employed in order to analyze the overall performance of the WT over the study period. Several cases are analyzed with five-year SCADA data and maintenance information is utilized to develop and validate the proposed approach.

AB Relevant classification of the stationary operating conditions of wind turbines (WTs) aids in the selection of an optimal condition monitoring technique. This paper presents a general method that can be used to classify the operating conditions of WTs in terms of rotor speed and power. In this study, the ideal probability density functions (PDFs) of rotor speed and power are calculated using an analytic WT model and a wind speed profile. To estimate the PDFs of rotor speed and power with field data, two methods are employed: (1) empirical PDF-based and (2) Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based. The individual PDFs estimated by the two methods are used to quantitatively define the range of the stationary WT operating conditions. The proposed methods and the range of stationary operating conditions established by the methods were evaluated using data from an analytical WT model and an actual 2.5 megawatt WT in the field. In addition, the paper presents the evaluation of the performance of the proposed class-wise condition monitoring strategy when used with vibration signals acquired from a two kilowatt WT testbed. In summary, the proposed strategy and methods are promising for effective condition monitoring of WTs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wind turbine (WT) blades are vulnerable to failure as they are exposed to direct harsh environment, suffering constantly varying loads by wind and cyclic fatigue load due to self-weight, experiencing extreme temperature and humidity changes, erosion and corrosion. As a consequence, blades show high failure rate and share significant downtime, which highlight the significance and essentiality of the research, development and application of blade structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques. To fulfil reliable SHM of WT blades, much effort has been spent in the past years as reported in the literature. However, to date, how to realise reliable WT blade SHM is still an open question. The previous reviews enumerate the non-destructive testing techniques that are potentially applicable to blade SHM, but they fail to indicate which technique is most suitable for blade SHM and how to implement reliable SHM of a WT blade. To fill this gap, this study is geared toward to investigate the pros and cons of existing blade SHM techniques and following which, a newly developed blade SHM technique that is effective in both damage detection and fault location is discussed.

AB Due to constantly varying wind speed, wind turbine (WT) components often operate at variable speeds in order to capture more energy from wind. As a consequence, WT condition monitoring (CM) signals always contain intra-wave features, which are difficult to extract through performing conventional time-frequency analysis (TFA) because none of which is locally adaptive. So far, only empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and its extension forms can extract intra-wave features. However, the EMD and those EMD-based techniques also suffer a number of defects in TFA (e.g. weak robustness of against noise, unidentified ripples, inefficiency in detecting side-band frequencies etc.). The existence of these issues has significantly limited the extensive application of the EMD family techniques to WT CM. Recently, an alternative TFA method, namely variational mode decomposition (VMD), was proposed to overcome all these issues. The purpose of this study is to verify the superiorities of the VMD over the EMD and investigate its potential application to the future WT CM. Experiment has shown that the VMD outperforms the EMD not only in noise robustness but also in multi-component signal decomposition, side-band detection, and intra-wave feature extraction. Thus, it has potential as a promising technique for WT CM.

AB Wind energy is one of the important renewable energy resources available in nature. It is one of the major resources for production of energy because of its dependability due to the development of the technology and relatively low cost. Wind energy is converted into electrical energy using rotating blades. Due to environmental conditions and large structure, the blades are subjected to various vibration forces that may cause damage to the blades. This leads to a liability in energy production and turbine shutdown. The downtime can be reduced when the blades are diagnosed continuously using structural health condition monitoring. These are considered as a pattern recognition problem which consists of three phases namely, feature extraction, feature selection, and feature classification. In this study, statistical features were extracted from vibration signals, feature selection was carried out using a J48 decision tree algorithm and feature classification was performed using best-first tree algorithm and functional trees algorithm. The better algorithm is suggested for fault diagnosis of wind turbine blade. (C) 2017 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID TEMPERATURE; OPERATION
AB Thermal coupling between adjacent insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) or diode chips is the result of nonuniform temperature distribution in a multichip IGBT module. This affects the junction temperatures and hence the total power loss predicted for the module. The study first investigates the impact of thermal coupling effect on the junction temperatures through a finite element method, and then develops a thermal coupling impedance model to represent such effects. The effect is shown to reduce with the distance exponentially. The model result agrees well with the test. The validated model is then used to predict the junction temperature swings during operational power cycling in a doubly fed induction generator wind turbine, showing the difference between the rotor and grid side converters. The model presented and the results obtained may be important for reliability evaluation and condition monitoring in the wind turbine power converters as well as in other multichip-paralleled power electronic systems.

ID RUB-IMPACT FAULT; DIAGNOSIS; SPECTRUM
AB Reliable condition monitoring (CM) highly relies on the correct extraction of fault-related features from CM signals. This equally applies to the CM of wind turbines (WTs). Although influenced by slowly rotating speeds and constantly varying loading, extracting fault characteristics from lengthy, nonlinear, non-stationary WT CM signals is extremely difficult, which makes WT CM one of the most challenge tasks in wind power asset management despites that lots of efforts have been spent. Attributed to the superiorities to empirical mode decomposition and its extension form Hilbert-Huang transform in dealing with nonlinear, non-stationary CM signals, the recently developed variational mode decomposition (VMD) casts a glimmer of light for the solution for this issue. However, the original proposed VMD adopts default values for both number of modes and filter frequency bandwidth. It is not adaptive to the signal being inspected. As a consequence, it would lead to inaccurate feature extraction thus unreliable WT CM result sometimes. For this reason, a precise feature extraction method based on optimised VMD is investigated. The experiments have shown that thanks to the use of the proposed optimisation strategies, the fault-related features buried in WT CM signals have been extracted out successfully.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Condition monitoring in permanent magnet synchronous machines has gained interest due to the increasing use in applications such as electric traction and power generation. Particularly in wind power generation, non-invasive condition monitoring techniques are of great importance. Usually, in such applications the access to the generator is complex and costly, while unexpected breakdowns results in high repair costs. This paper presents a technique which allows using vibration analysis for bearing fault detection in permanent magnet synchronous generators used in wind turbines. Given that in wind power applications the generator rotational speed may vary during normal operation, it is necessary to use special sampling techniques to apply spectral analysis of mechanical vibrations. In this work, a resampling technique based on order tracking without measuring the rotor position is proposed. To synchronize sampling with rotor position, an estimation of the rotor position obtained from the angle of the voltage vector is proposed. This angle is obtained from a phase-locked loop synchronized with the generator voltages. The proposed strategy is validated by laboratory experimental results obtained from a permanent magnet synchronous generator. Results with single point defects in the outer race of a bearing under variable speed and load conditions are presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Blade condition monitoring systems with fiber-optic sensors attract much attention because they are resistant to lightning strikes, a major issue with increasing blade lengths. However, fiber-optic sensor systems are more complex and more expensive than their electronic counterparts. We describe a new blade condition monitoring system, which combines the lightning safety of optical fibers with the reliability and cost-effectiveness of electronic sensors. The optical fibers transport data from the blades to the hub, and in addition, they provide the electrical power for operating the sensor units in the blades. To achieve full protection against lightning-induced electromagnetic fields, an appropriate shielding of the sensor units is required. We present results on the reliability of a newly developed prototype based on optically powered sensors. In a field trial, the unit monitored successfully the blade vibrations of a 1.5MW wind turbine for a period of 23months. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Reducing operation and the maintenance costs of wind turbines has become a primary issue of wind farm owners and operators. Since the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system has been widely used in wind farms, it is costeffective to use SCADA data to realize condition monitoring. To this end, this paper proposes a method to calculate health index of wind turbines based on SCADA data. This method uses kernel density estimatison (KDE), then calculate the relative health index (RHI) of all wind turbines in a certain wind farm. To show the effectiveness of the method, we apply our method to real SCADA data of several wind farms. The result shows that RHI can reflect the health status of each wind turbine. Therefore, it is convenient to maintain the turbines with low RHI, thus to save maintenance costs.

DE wind turbine condition monitoring; nonlinear state estimation technique
   (NSET); vibration; SCADA
AB In this paper, we introduce the vibration acceleration signals combined with SCADA data to implement condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of the key components for wind turbines. Experimental data is from a wind turbine in six months with continuous SCADA data. Then three vibration models are established using the nonlinear state estimation technique (NSET) according to the SCADA data collected during the wind turbine is working normally. The three vibration models are used to describe the complex relationship between the gearbox vibration, generator vibration, main bearing vibration and the parameters that govern its behavior. These models can also be used as a reference to help detect incipient failure. The study shows NSET is an effective and simple way to model the relationship between the gearbox vibration, generator vibration, main bearing vibration with different related parameters in a high precision. And at the same time it provides a new train of thought for wind vibration analysis.

The failure rate is high occurred in gearbox, while gearbox oil temperature can reflect the operating state of the transmission structure within gearbox. In this paper, lit a Support. Vector Machines (SVM) regression to model gearbox oil temperature using selected variables in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data as predictors. Sequential Feature Selection (SFS) algorithm is applied to determine the number and the type of features in the feature sets. If the residual falls outside the probabilistic prediction interval, an early warning will be given in real time. It is verified that the method proposed can give an early warning about 10 days before the actual faults.

AB During the last decades, an emerging interest has been reported on modelling rotating machinery signals as cyclostationary. Several tools, such as the Spectral Correlation Density (SCD) and the Cyclic Modulation Spectrum (CMS) have been proposed, assuming constant or almost constant rotating speed. To overcome this limitation, generalizations of SCD and CMS have been proposed that display cyclic Order versus Frequency. On the other hand the estimation of the instantaneous angular speed of the rotating machine is a crucial issue that has to be tackled before any analysis or diagnosis of the machine operating under non stationary conditions. This operation is generally carried out thanks to a tachometer, or an angle encoder, but in some cases this information can be missing for different reasons. The goal of this paper is to combine a novel approach for the analysis of cyclo-non-stationary signals based on the generalization of the indicators of cyclostationarity in order to cover the speed varying conditions, introducing a new speed-dependent angle averaging operator, with a new speed estimation method, that extracts from a vibration signal the most probable instantaneous rotation frequency without focusing on one specific order based on the a priori knowledge of the kinematics of the machine. The effectiveness of the ensemble method is evaluated on an acceleration signal captured at the wind turbine gearbox operating under speed varying conditions.

AB Sparse representation of massive condition monitoring signals is an effective approach to save the cost for data storage and transmission in fault diagnosis of wind turbines. This paper explores a sparse representation method over a new dictionary designed particularly for bearing vibration signals of wind turbines operating under varying-speed conditions. First, the time-varying shaft rotating frequency (SRF) of the wind turbine contained in the vibration signal(s) is estimated from a generator current signal recorded synchronously with the vibration signal. Then, a new dictionary is designed, in which the basic functions, called time-varying cosine packet, change with the SRF. Finally, a sparse coefficient spectrum (SCS) of the vibration envelope signal is constructed by the sparse coefficients of the signal projection on the new dictionary. The merit of the proposed sparse representation method is that the dictionary designed is adaptive to the variations of major frequencies of the vibration signals. The nonzero sparse coefficients over the dictionary designed represent the major order components contained in the vibration signal. Therefore, the possible bearing fault characteristic orders can be identified from the SCS of the vibration envelope signal. Laboratory and field test results show that the sparse coefficients obtained by the new sparse representation method are suitable for the representations of the bearing vibration signals and the SCS is effective for bearing fault diagnosis of direct-drive wind turbines.

AB Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are considered key features in order to increase the reliability and availability levels of wind turbine systems. Accordingly, this paper proposes a single fault diagnostic algorithm for multiple IGBTs open-circuit faults and current sensor faults in direct-driven wind turbines, based on permanent magnet synchronous generators with full-scale back-to-back converters. The proposed method is based on the currents residual generation and on a new adaptive threshold approach. This threshold is calculated from the measured currents and their corresponding reference signals that are already available from the main control system. The proposed diagnostic technique is applied to both generator-side and grid-side converters of a conventional back-to-back topology. Several simulations are presented, showing the algorithm reliability against false alarms under both multiple IGBTs and current sensor faults in the back-to-back converter.

AB Currently, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are deployed in most wind farms, with the low cost of data acquisition. However, SCADA data contains a lot of redundant and dirty information, which makes it difficult to observe the actual condition ofWind Turbine (WT) or WT's components directly. In this paper, a gearbox condition monitoring (CM) model of WT based on SCADA data is proposed. In the first stage, after data preprocessing, the prediction model of gearbox oil temperature is obtained based on healthy data with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and the absolute percentage error (APE) of oil temperature is the final observational variable. In the second stage, the Multivariate Quality Control Charts (MQCC) is used to generate the threshold to detect the fault symptoms, combined with the APE of healthy data. Afterwards, the CM framework is established, which is capable of identifying the abnomal state of gearboxes based on whether the APE of new data exceeds the threshold. Finally, the effectiveness of the gearbox CM model presented is demonstrated by examining 2 groups of WT from different wind farms in China.

Condition monitoring and fault detection of WTs reduce both downtimes and costs in the electric service. In this regard, it is important to ensure their safety and reliability. This paper presents a methodology based on the wavelet packet transform (WPT) for detection of unbalance fault in a WT. In general, the methodology consists of the acquisition and analysis of vibration signals coming from the WT. For vibration signals, WPT is firstly applied. Then, one node of the wavelet packet tree is analyzed using an energy index. This index is computed as a fault feature. Finally, a statistical analysis is carried out in order to observe the capability of discriminating between a nominal condition and a fault condition. Obtained results show that the proposal can detect the unbalance fault.

AB Wind turbine spindle is the connecting part of impeller and gearbox. It has the function of transmitting torque and energy in the transmission chain of the unit. It needs to bear the bending moment and thrust of the wind wheel, so the failure rate of spindle is high. Therefore, the condition monitoring of the spindle is directly related to the stability of wind turbine and power generation. The spindle temperature model is established and used to predict by the nonlinear state estimate technology under the normal operating condition of the spindle. When the spindle fails, the observation vector of the model input changes obviously, resulting in a significant change of the prediction residual. In order to improve the sensitivity and reliability of the spindle anomaly early warning, using the double moving window calculate the statistic properties of the residual sequence based on the Lewitt criteria. If the residual mean or standard deviation exceeds the set fault alarm threshold, an alarm message will be issued. Using the actual operating data of wind turbine spindles verify the validity of this method.

ID SENSOR PLACEMENT
AB Wind turbine gearboxes, as the key components of current wind power equipment, are crucial hubs connecting the main shaft to the generator. The internal structure and force of wind turbine gearboxes are complex especially when they are working under various conditions and alternating loads, which can easily result in fault. Therefore, condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of wind power gearboxes are very important to ensure the reliability of the wind power equipment operation. Currently, the structure of wind turbine gearboxes is mainly composed of primary planet transmission and secondary parallel shaft gear transmission. Therefore, once faults occur in planetary gears, transfer paths of the fault vibration signals are timevariant, imposing great challenges to fault diagnosis of wind turbine gearboxes. Meanwhile, due to the influence of transfer paths, the signal sensitivities of diverse measuring points are different, so research on the sensitive measuring points in favor of obtaining fault information is critical to improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis based on vibration signals. Firstly, this paper utilizes the adaptive resonance-based sparse signal decomposition to decompose vibration signals of wind turbine gearboxes, and extracts high-resonance components, low-resonance components and redundant components. The fault feature information obtained from the study is mainly contained in the high-resonance components. Then, the paper uses the relative kurtosis index to analyze and evaluate the high-resonance components of each measuring point. And the concept of relative kurtosis which is used to evaluate the sensitivity of measuring points is proposed. Finally, the locations of sensitive measuring points are determined. The method is applied to the diagnosis of planet carrier bearing outer fault and planetary gear localized spalling fault in a planetary speed-increasing gearbox, which indicates the validity of the research results.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB To improve the reliability of wind turbines, various condition monitoring systems (CMSs) have been developed and most of them transmit data using wired communication channels. Recently, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been used to transmit data in wind turbine CMS due to the low cost and easy deployment feature of WSNs. However, since wind turbines are installed in harsh environments, the sensors and sensor nodes used in the WSN-based wind turbines CMSs are easily subject to faults, leading to corruption of the signals used for condition monitoring, which decreases the reliability of the CMS. This paper proposes a three-stage method for detection and isolation of three most common sensor faults, i.e., SHORT fault, CONSTANT fault, and NOISE fault, in WSN-based wind turbine CMS. The proposed sensor fault detection and isolation (SFDI) greatly increases the accuracy and reliability of wind turbine CMSs. Data collected from wind turbines in the field are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The objective of this paper is to investigate the frequency-based fault detection of a 5MW spar-type floating wind turbine (WT) gearbox using measurements of the global responses. It is extremely costly to seed managed defects in a real WT gearbox to investigate different fault detection and condition monitoring approaches; using analytical tools, therefore, is one of the promising approaches in this regard. In this study, forces and moments on the main shaft are obtained from the global response analysis using an aero-hydro-servo-elastic code, SIMO-RIFLEX-AeroDyn. Then, they are utilized as inputs to a high-fidelity gearbox model developed using a multi body simulation software (SIMPACK). The main shaft bearing is one of the critical components since it protects gearbox from axial and radial loads. Six different fault cases with different severity in this bearing are investigated using power spectral density (PSD) of relative axial acceleration of the bearing and nacelle. It is shown that in severe degradation of this bearing the first stage dynamic of the gearbox is dominant in the main shaft vibration signal. Inside the gearbox, the bearings on the high speed side are those often with high probability of failure, thus, one fault case in IMS-B bearing was also considered. Based on the earlier studies, the angular velocity error function is considered as residual for this fault. The Hilbert transform is used to determine the envelope of this residual. Information on the amplitude of this residual properly indicates damage in this bearing. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID COST-ANALYSIS
AB Operation and Maintenance (O&M) is an important cost driver of modern wind turbines. Condition monitoring (CM) allows the implementation of predictive O&M strategies helping to reduce costs. In this work a novel approach for wind turbine condition monitoring is proposed focusing on synergistic effects of coexisting sensing technologies. The main objective is to understand the predictability of signals using information from other measurements recorded at different locations of the turbine. The approach is based on a multi-step procedure to pre-process data, train a set of conversion functions and evaluate their performance. A subsequent sensitivity analysis measuring the impact of the input variables on the predicted response reveals hidden relationships between signals. The concept feasibility is tested in a case study using Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) data from an offshore turbine. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Wind power has become the most important component of renewable energy with advances in technology in recent years. Reducing operations and maintenance cost effectively and detecting the fault timely for wind turbines are critical to expand wind power use. Due to difficult access and harsh environment, offshore wind turbines have more urgent need for reducing operations and maintenance costs. This paper reviews typical failure modes of wind turbines and compares condition monitoring and diagnostics techniques for wind turbines based on electrical signature analysis with conventional analysis. With less demand for sensors, electrical signature analysis techniques is the key to promote wind industry.

AB Prognostic health management is an effective approach to enhance the reliability and reduce downtime of rotating machines, such as wind turbines. To achieve effective health management, fault prognosis is indispensable. This paper proposes a fault prognostic method for drivetrain gearboxes, which are one of the most troublesome subassemblies in wind turbines. The proposed method consists of signal collection, health index extraction, health index prediction, and decision making for maintenance. The signal used for fault prognosis is a phase current measured from the generator connected with the gearbox. A health index called noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) of the current signal is proposed to reflect the health condition of the gearbox. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is designed to predict the health index online and maintenance is scheduled when the predicted health index reaches a predetermined threshold. The proposed fault prognostic method is validated by the data obtained from an accelerated gearbox run-to-failure experiment for an emulated wind turbine drivetrain consisting of a gearbox and a generator.

AB One of the most challenging scenarios in condition monitoring is the bearing fault detection within strongly masked signal, where the vibration or acoustic signal is dominated by other component such as gears and shafts, a good example for this scenario is the wind turbine gearbox which presents one of the difficult bearing detection tasks. Nonstationary signal analysis is considered one of the main topics in field of machinery fault diagnosis. A set of signal processing techniques has been studied to investigate their feasibility for bearing fault detection in wind turbine gearbox. These techniques include statistical condition indicators, Spectral kurtosis, and envelope analysis.
   The result of vibration analysis showed the possibility of bearing detection in wind turbine high speed shaft using multiple signal processing techniques. However, among all these signal processing techniques, Spectral Kurtosis followed by envelope analysis provides early fault detection compared to the other techniques employed.

AB Current methods for fault diagnosis of wind turbine gearbox are mainly based on three types of condition monitoring data, namely temperature, vibration and shock. In practice. These three types of data are often used individually, with each one having its own limitations. In this study, based on the multi-source information fusion and an improved D-S (Dempster-Shafer) evidence theory, we proposed a practical method for fault diagnosis of wind turbine gearbox using synchronous or quasi-synchronous sampling data of temperature, vibration, and shock. Through real experiments, it is shown that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of diagnosis, and reduce the false alarm rate comparing to method using single type of data.

AB This study developed a design for a wind turbine monitoring warning device comprising a sensing unit, data acquisition module, storage unit, and comparator, all of which are connected by electrical connections. The sensing turn can accommodate multiple temperature sensors, speed sensors, and accelerators. It first obtains a baseline set of temperature, speed, and acceleration data. The data acquisition module then transmits the baseline data to the storage unit to be saved as warning values. The comparator compares subsequent data sets with the warning values. If the values of the subsequent data exceed the warning values, a warning indicator issues an audible or visual warning.

   analysis
AB An universal approach for building the wind turbines (WT) prediction models has been proposed. BPNN is used to establish the forecasting model from the perspective of large data analysis based on the SCADA data. First, the power quality of wind turbines can affect the power supply to the grid, thus the power can represent the performance of the WTs. So the active power is selected as the output of the model. Other condition parameters are clustered based on k-means methods in which the silhouette coefficient is used as the basis of clustering. Second, correlations within the class are calculated and unrelated quantities in each class are maintained to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Then the remaining condition parameters associated with the output power are retained. Thus the large condition parameters can be represented by several representative parameters as input to the prediction model. Finally, according to the relative error probability distribution to monitor WTs' condition, this method can be widely used in any wind farm. The proposed method can effectively remove the redundant parameters, thus can be more intuitively and quickly used for condition monitoring.

ID JUNCTION TEMPERATURE
AB The failure of power converters is currently the main reason of stopping for wind turbines. The unpredictable nature of wind power flow causes temperature swings to the semiconductor devices, which leads to additional thermal stresses and, eventually, unexpected failures. A suitable way to avoid this is using condition monitoring systems, which detect the degradation of the devices and reduce the stopping time by a planned maintenance. The choice of the most appropriate early failure detector is therefore essential to make sure that the condition monitoring system is accurate and indicates a fault only when this is actually occurring. For this reason, this paper focusses on the sensitivity analysis of switching parameters in response to a variation of the load and the dc-bus voltage, which may introduce uncertainty in the detection of early fault as they have a direct influence on the device temperature. The results of the experimental investigation show a substantial sensitivity of switching parameters to dc-bus voltage variation and a moderate sensitivity to load variation.

How to deal with the monitoring data more efficiently is of great significance to the accurate judgment of the fault. This paper proposes the use of cloud platform to deal with massive data to improve efficiency. Firstly, the state monitoring model of wind turbine is put forward. Then, the fuzzy C means clustering algorithm is introduced, and the algorithm process is realized by MapReduce model. Finally, the experiment is carried out with Hadoop platform, using distributed database HBase to store data, and using distributed programming framework MapReduce to calculate data. It is found that with the increase of the data volume and the number of nodes, the cloud platform is able to store and calculate data at a faster speed.

AB For reducing effect of energy production on the climate change, renewable energy sources play a very important role in the global energy mix. Wind energy has the largest share in the renewable energy technologies with approximately 433 GW of globally installed capacity as of 2015. Share of power production through Wind Turbine (WT) technique is growing day by day and there is an urgent need to control the cost of operation and maintenance of these systems. For early detection of failures or faults we use Condition monitoring (CM) technique for WT in order to maximize productivity and minimize downtime. In this paper we present a method for CM of WT gearbox using vibration data. We have used Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique for feature extraction and Neural network train tool which is based on MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) model for classification. The focus is on the gearbox, as it is typically one of the most crucial components in terms of long average down time and high failure rates. The opportunities and challenges are identified to help in conducting future research in enhancing the ability and accuracy of CM and prognosis systems for WT gearboxes.

AB This paper deals with the health monitoring of a wind turbine drivetrain in a system perspective. A 5-MW reference drivetrain installed on a spar type floating wind turbine is selected. Degradation and damage in the main bearing which carries the axial loads can cause severe damage inside the gearbox as it causes non-torque loads entering the gearbox. Therefore, monitoring of the main bearing is very important. In this paper, different fault cases of the main bearing are considered and responses are obtained by the multi-body simulation. Gearbox failure is then evaluated in two different perspectives: one from the main bearing itself by analysing vibration, and one through studying the remaining fatigue life of another bearing inside the gearbox. The results reveal that not only the local vibration of the main bearing housing is important, but also the consequence of this degradation on other components can be a key factor in the "system" failure. This is a step forward in monitoring the wind turbine drivetrains on a system level. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; MOTORS
AB Operation and maintenance (O&M) of wind turbines is recently becoming the spotlight in the wind energy sector. While wind turbine power capacities continue to increase and new offshore developments are being installed, O&M costs keep raising. With the objective of reducing such costs, the new trends are moving from corrective and preventive maintenance toward predictive actions. In this scenario, condition monitoring (CM) has been identified as the key to achieve this goal. The induction generator of a wind turbine is a major contributor to failure rates and downtime where doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG) are the dominant technology employed in variable speed wind turbines. The current work presents the analysis of an in-service DFIG. A one-year measurement campaign has been used to perform the study. Several signal processing techniques have been applied and the optimal method for CM has been identified. A diagnosis has been reached, the DFIG under study shows potential gearbox damage.

AB SCADA-based condition monitoring of wind turbines facilitates the move from costly corrective repairs towards more proactive maintenance strategies. In this work, we advocate the use of high-frequency SCADA data and quantile regression to build a cost effective performance monitoring tool. The benefits of the approach are demonstrated through the comparison between state-of-the-art deterministic power curve modelling techniques and the suggested probabilistic model. Detection capabilities are compared for low and high-frequency SCADA data, providing evidence for monitoring at higher resolutions. Operational data from healthy and faulty turbines are used to provide a practical example of usage with the proposed tool, effectively achieving the detection of an incipient gearbox malfunction at a time horizon of more than one month prior to the actual occurrence of the failure.

ID DESIGN
AB Reliability analysis and probabilistic models for wind turbines are considered with special focus on structural components and application for reliability-based calibration of partial safety factors. The main design load cases to be considered in design of wind turbine components are presented including the effects of the control system and possible faults due to failure of electrical / mechanical components. Considerations are presented on the target reliability level for wind turbine structural components. Application is shown for reliability-based calibrations of partial safety factors for extreme and fatigue limit states are presented. Operation & Maintenance planning often follows corrective and preventive strategies based on information from condition monitoring and structural health monitoring systems. A reliability- and risk-based approach is presented where a life-cycle approach is used. An example with wind turbine blades is considered using the NORCOWE reference wind farm.

AB This paper proposes new seismic-based methods for use in the wind energy industry with a focus on wind turbine condition monitoring. Fourteen Streckeisen STS-2 Broadband seismometers and two 3D sonic anemometers are deployed in/near an operating wind farm to collect the data used in these proof-of-principle analyses. The interquartile mean (IQM) value of power spectral density (PSD) of the seismic components in 10-minute time series are used to characterize the spectral signatures (i.e. frequencies with enhanced variance) in ground vibrations deriving from vibrations of wind turbine subassemblies. A power spectral envelope approach is taken in which the probability density function of seismic PSD is developed using seismic data collected under normal turbine operation. These power spectral envelopes clearly show the energy distribution of wind-turbine-induced ground vibrations over a wide frequency range. Singular PSD lying outside the power spectral envelopes can be easily identified, and are used herein along with SCADA data to diagnose the associated suboptimal turbine operating conditions. Illustrative examples are given herein for periods with yaw-misalignment and excess tower acceleration. It is additionally shown that there is a strong association between drivetrain acceleration and seismic spectral power in a frequency band of 2.5-12.5 Hz. The long-term goal of the research is development of seismic-based condition monitoring (SBCM) for wind turbines. The primary advantages of SBCM are that the approach is low-cost, non-invasive and versatile (i.e., one seismic sensor monitoring for multiple turbine subassemblies).

AB Particularly offshore there is a trend to cluster wind turbines in large wind farms, and in the near future to operate such a farm as an integrated power production plant. Predictability of individual turbine behavior across the entire fleet is key in such a strategy. Failure of turbine subcomponents should be detected well in advance to allow early planning of all necessary maintenance actions; Such that they can be performed during low wind and low electricity demand periods. In order to obtain the insights to predict component failure, it is necessary to have an integrated clean dataset spanning all turbines of the fleet for a sufficiently long period of time. This paper illustrates our big-data approach to do this. In addition, advanced failure detection algorithms are necessary to detect failures in this dataset. This paper discusses a multi-level monitoring approach that consists of a combination of machine learning and advanced physics based signal-processing techniques. The advantage of combining different data sources to detect system degradation is in the higher certainty due to multivariable criteria. In order to able to perform long-term acceleration data signal processing at high frequency a streaming processing approach is necessary. This allows the data to be analysed as the sensors generate it. This paper illustrates this streaming concept on 5kHz acceleration data. A continuous spectrogram is generated from the data-stream. Real-life offshore wind turbine data is used. Using this streaming approach for calculating bearing failure features on continuous acceleration data will support failure propagation detection.

AB The demand for wind energy grows at exponential rates. At the same time improving reliability, reduced operation and maintenance costs are the key priorities in wind tur-bine maintenance strategies [1]. This paper provides information about a novel online oil condition monitoring system to give a solution to the mentioned priorities. The presented sensor system enables damage prevention of the wind turbine gear-box by an advanced warning time of critical operation conditions and an enhanced oil exchange interval realized by a precise measurement of the electrical conductivity, the relative permittivity and the oil temperature. A new parameter, the WearSens (R) Index (WSi) is introduced. The mathematical model of the WSi combines all measured values and its gradients in one single parameter for a comprehensive monitoring to prevent wind turbines from damage. Furthermore, the WSi enables a long-term prognosis on the next oil change by 24/7 server data logging. Corrective procedures and/or maintenance can be carried out before actual damage occurs. First WSi results of an onshore wind turbine installation compared to traditional vibration monitoring are shown.

AB Online condition monitoring systems play an important role in preventing catastrophic failure, reducing maintenance costs, and improving the system reliability. In this paper, wind turbine gearbox mechanical fault detection system is developed. An adaptive filtering technique is applied to separate the impulsive components from the periodic components of the vibration signals. Then different features of the periodic components and impulsive components are extracted. An extreme learning machine based classifier is designed and trained by using the features extracted from simulated vibration data of wind turbine gearbox. Simulated vibration signals of wind turbines gearbox are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented methodology.

AB With a larger implementation of Condition Monitoring Systems in Wind Turbine Generators in the market, and with a better understanding of the capabilities and possibilities of those systems by the turbine owners, more importance is given to all aspects of the results attained with such technology in a monitoring programme.
   For instance, in practical terms, Vibration Monitoring Systems for turbines are engineered under a combination of technical, operational and economic factors. Currently, the focus is to monitor primarily the key rotating assets on a turbine, typically the main shaft bearing, the gearbox and the generator. But even within these assets, not all their building parts (components) can be equally monitored, the spot light is put usually on bearings, gears and shafts, as critical items.
   The industry has gained good experience in monitoring key assets and key components over the last years. However, other damages also occur on other parts of the main drive train of wind turbines causing severe operational and economic consequences. The failure rate of non-primary components, or secondary damage, while percentage-wise it is small the industry still calls for a better detection and identification of the patterns of these secondary damages, so that the results of vibration monitoring programmes of turbines is improved.

AB Wind energy is one of the most competitive and efficient renewable energy. It requires an efficient management system to reduce costs, predict failures and increase the production. The main objective of this paper is to design the appropriate tests and develop a condition monitoring system (CMS) to display the surface temperature of any body state using infrared radiation. The data obtained from this system lead to identify the state of the surface. The CMS is used for maintenance management of wind turbines because it is necessary an effective system to display the surface temperature to reduce the energy losses. This paper analyses numerous scenarios and experiments on different surfaces in preparation for actual measurements of blade surfaces.

AB Operation and maintenance tasks on the wind turbines have an essential role to ensure the correct condition of the system and to minimize losses and increase the productivity. The condition monitoring systems installed on the main components of the wind turbines provide information about the tasks that should be carried out over the time. A novel statistical methodology for multivariable analysis of big data from wind turbines is presented in this paper. The objective is to analyse the necessary information from the condition monitoring systems installed in wind farms. The novel approach filters the main parameters from the collected signals and uses advanced computational techniques for evaluating the data and giving meaning to them. The main advantage of the approach is the possibility of the big data analysis based on the main information available.

AB Wind turbines blades rotate and flutter in extreme weather and fatigue loading conditions while subjected to random wind speeds. Furthermore, the wind turbines are usually located in remote areas with elevated heights thus difficult to be reached, examined, and assessed. Therefore, performing maintenance and repair is very challenging process due to the difficult and limited machine accessibility. The wind turbine blades conditions have significant contribution to turbine durability, reliability and performance issues, practically for offshore and megawatt-class wind turbines. Hence, to ensure their proper functioning, a robust condition monitoring system (CMS) for early detection of blade deterioration to be developed and implemented. Experimental modal analysis investigates the effect of structure dynamics variations, which may result from the presence and propagation of cracks, on the behaviour of the vibrational modal parameters including modal frequencies, modal shapes and damping. To enable the emulation of wind turbine blades, a stepped beam is used in this paper to examine the application of experimental Modal Analysis technique in identification of blade fault. The aim is to assess the applicability of using the experimental modal analysis as a structural health monitoring (SHM) approach for wind turbine blades. An impact hammer test has been performed for the stepped beam with different crack sizes located at predetermined places. The Frequency Response Function (FRF) has been obtained experimentally as the frequency response ratio of the structure output to the input excitation force, H (omega) = X (omega)/F (omega). The stepped beam FRF has been calculated at different impact location and 3D plots are generated to define the structure modal shape. The results proved that the use of modal parameters allow for the detection and estimation of crack size in the stepped beam, hence motivate and provide a reference to investigate its implementation to wind turbine blades.

AB Planning and scheduling for wind farms play a critical role in the costs of maintenance. The use and analysis of field data or so-called Product Use Information (PUI) to improve maintenance activities and to reduce the costs has gained attention in the recent years. The product use data consist of sources such as measure of sensors on the turbines, the alarms information or signals from the condition monitoring, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, which are currently used in maintenance activities. However, those data have the potential to offer alternative solutions to improve processes and provide better decisions, by transforming them into actionable knowledge. In order to make the right decision it is important to understand, which PUI data source and which data analysis methods, are suitable for what kind of decision making task. The aim of this study is to discover, how analysis of PUI can help in the maintenance processes of off-shore wind power. The techniques from the field of big data analytics for analyzing the PUI are here addressed. The results of this study contain suggestions on the basis of algorithms of data analytics, suitable for each decision type. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Wind turbine (WT) blade is one of the most important components in WTs, as it is the key component for receiving wind energy and has direct influence on WT operation stability. As the size of modern turbine blade increases, condition monitoring and maintenance of blades become more important. Strain detection is one of the most effective methods to monitor blade conditions. In this paper, a distributed fiber-optic strain sensor is used for blade monitoring. Preliminary experimental tests have been carried out over a 14 m long WT composite blade, demonstrating the possibility of performing distributed strain and vibration measurements.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB According to its high robustness, the use of doubly-fed induction generators in the wind energy conversion takes an important place in the world of production of electrical energy. This type of conversion became very attractive because of its manufacturing environments, low cost and operation with an easily available power supply. The increase interest in wind energy conversion has been accompanied by efforts to improve reliability, effective condition monitoring and better efficiency. In this work, a new technique is proposed for monitoring and detection of inter-turn short-circuit ITSC and open phase circuits in the stator or rotor windings of wind turbines based on doubly-fed induction generator The principle of the suggested technique is based on the acquisition of the stator and the rotor currents of a doubly-fed induction generator with the aim to calculate the values of root mean square amplitude, in addition to the knowledge expressed in rules and membership function. This technique is verified using simulations performed via the model of doubly-fed induction generators built in MATLAB (R) Simulink.

AB The aim of this study is to discuss the characteristics of the input data to the data analytical algorithms of a predictive maintenance system, from the viewpoint of big data technology. The discussed application is for the maintenance of off-shore wind turbines. The maintenance of off-shore wind turbines is an expensive and sensitive task. Therefore, making decision for planning and scheduling of maintenance in a wind farm (which is made by the operating company of a wind farm) is important and plays a critical role in the cost of maintenance. In this paper, the current state of the art for big data technology in the maintenance of off-shore wind turbines is presented. The dimensions of big data analytics and the technical requirements of data for the use of this technology in the maintenance of off-shore wind turbines are described. A contribution of this paper is to study the technical requirements of suitable data for decision-making. The outcomes of presented study are identifying the characteristics of input data to predictive maintenance in the era of big data and the discussion of these characteristics in the condition monitoring for off-shore wind energy.

AB This article presents a two-stage fault detection and classification scheme, for induction motor drives in wind turbine pitch systems. The presented approach is suitable for application in offshore wind farms. The adopted strategy utilizes three phase motor current sensing at the pitch drives for fault detection and only when a fault is detected at this stage, features extracted from the current signals are transmitted to a central support. vector machine classifier. The proposed method is validated in a laboratory setup of the pitch drive.

AB Serious accidents with property damage or even human casualties, result from structural flaws in wind turbine rotor blades. Common maintenance practices result in long downtimes and do not lead to the required results. Therefore, the Ruhr West University of Applied Sciences and the iQbis Consulting GmbH, currently research a new structural health monitoring method for wind turbine rotor blades. The goal of this project is to build a sensor system that can detect structural weaknesses inside of rotor blades without the need of downtime for industrial climbers. This technology has the potential to prevent accidents, save lives, extend the useful life of wind turbines and optimize the production of green energy.

AB Fault diagnosis of drivetrain gearboxes is a prominent challenge in wind turbine condition monitoring. Many machine learning algorithms have been applied to gearbox fault diagnosis. However, many of the current machine learning algorithms did not provide satisfactory fault diagnostic results due to their shallow architectures. Recently, a class of machine learning models with deep architectures called deep learning has received more attention because it can learn high-level features of inputs. This paper proposes a new fault diagnosis method for drivetrain gearbox of DFIG wind turbines using rotor current signal analysis. In the proposed method, the instantaneous fundamental frequency of the rotor current signal is first estimated to obtain the instantaneous shaft rotating frequency. Then, Hilbert transform is used to demodulate the rotor current signal to obtain its envelope, and the resultant envelope signal contains fault characteristic frequencies that are in proportion to the varying DFIG shaft rotating frequency. Next, an angular resampling algorithm is designed to resample the nonstationary envelope signal to be stationary based on the estimated instantaneous shaft rotating frequency. After that, the power spectral density analysis is performed on the resampled envelope signal for the gearbox fault detection. Finally, a classifier with a deep architecture that consists of a stacked autoencoder (SAE) and a support vector machine is proposed for gearbox fault classification using extracted fault features. Experimental results obtained from a DFIG wind turbine drivetrain test rig are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Todays installed multi-megawatt wind turbines (WT) form highly diverse system due to very complex control devices. Thus, special attention has to be paid to the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of the wind turbine. This contribution deals with different electromagnetic interference (EMI) and susceptibility (EMS) effects within the wind turbine. A well-known susceptibility problem of constructions and buildings with large vertical dimensions is the threat situation due to lightning phenomena. On the one hand, the high amplitude of the lightning current effects destructions of infrastructure directly. On the other hand, the transient electromagnetic fields caused by this lightning current could lead to disturbances as well as destructions of electronic devices inside the wind turbine. Furthermore, common-mode currents I-cm on the power lines between the generator and the frequency converter will cause EMI effects during the normal operation mode. These I-cm s lead to radiated emissions to the WT's environment as well as to transient disturbing fields inside the WT, which might interfere with the control unit (CU) and the condition monitoring system (CMS).
   These issues will be investigated in this contribution. Therefore, the electromagnetic topology (EMT) will be applied to the wind turbine. The EMT delivers useful information in order to increase the WT's susceptibility and ensure a high degree of availability.

AB Checking wind turbines for damage is a common problem for operators of wind parks, as regular inspections are legally required in many countries and prevention is economically viable. While some of the common forms of damage are easily visible on the surface, structural problems can remain invisible for years before they eventually result in catastrophic failure of a rotor blade. Common forms of testing fibre composite parts like ultrasonic testing or X-ray tests are impractical due to the large dimensions of wind turbine components and their limited accessibility for any short-range methods.
   Active thermographic inspection of wind turbines is a promising approach to testing for structural flaws beneath the surface of rotor blades. As part of an ongoing research project, a setup for testing the general viability of this method was built and used to compare different thermographic cameras. A sample cut from a discarded rotor blade was modified to emulate structural damage.
   The results are promising for the development of a cost effective on-site testing system.

AB The increasing amount of data produced in many scientific and engineering domains creates as many new challenges for an efficient data analysis, as possibilities for its application. In this paper, we present one of the use cases of the project VAVID, namely the condition monitoring of sensor information from wind turbines, and how a data gateway can help to increase the usability and security of the proposed system. Starting by briefly introducing the project, the paper presents the problem of handling and processing large amount of sensor data using existing tools in the context of wind turbines. It goes on to describe the innovative approach used in VAVID to meet this challenge, covering the main goals, numerical methods used for analysis, the storage concept, and the architectural design. It concludes by offering a rational for the use of a data gateway as the main entry point to the system and how this is being implemented in VAVID.

AB Tacholess order tracking method is an effective tool for condition monitoring of planetary gearbox under varying-speed operation to reduce the measurement cost and avoid the inconvenience in the installation and adjustment. The robust ridge estimation is an indispensable procedure in the tacholess order tracking. However, conventional ridge estimation methods are difficult to extract the targeted ridge from the highly nonstationary signals. In this paper, we propose a novel method, termed dual path optimization ridge estimation (DPORE), which implants the idea of local integration to adapt with the intensively oscillated ridge. An in-situ vibration signal collected from a wind turbine planetary gearbox provided by the contest during the conference CMMNO December 2014 is employed to validate the proposed method. As a result, an important time-frequency ridge with weak energy and intricate shape is successfully extracted by the proposed method, while two popular ridge estimation methods cannot well track the complete time-frequency ridge. Moreover, the results obtained by the proposed method outperform those provided by the contestants in the conference contest. Finally, the accuracy of estimated ridge is further demonstrated by order analysis and one of the planet bearings in planetary gearbox with an inner race defect can be detected based on the order spectrum.

AB Maintenance represents the major cost of energy from wind turbines, once they are installed, so much research effort is currently going into reducing the costs of maintenance through improved condition monitoring. The most efficient turbines vary in speed by a ratio of up to 2:1 (+/- 33%), and so techniques developed for constant speed machines can no longer be directly applied. This paper discusses a number of recently developed techniques for compensating for the effects of variable speed on vibration signals from wind turbine gearboxes, the most critical part of typical systems. In particular it is shown how the effects of speed on gears and bearings are quite different, and require different treatment, this having been disguised for constant speed machines. Though aimed at wind turbine gearboxes, the techniques proposed in this paper are applicable to any variable speed gearboxes.

AB Extensive prior studies aimed at the development of diagnostic methods for planetary gearboxes have mainly examined acceleration and acoustic emission signals. Recently, due to the relationship between gear mesh stiffness and transmission error (TE), TE-based techniques have emerged as a promising way to analyze dynamic behavior of spur and helical gears. However, to date, TE has not been used as a measure to detect faults in planetary gears. In this paper, we propose a new methodology for model-based fault diagnostics of planetary gears using TE signals. A lumped parametric model of planetary gear dynamics was built to extract simulated TE signals, while accounting for the planet phasing effect, which is a peculiar characteristic of the planetary gear. Next, gear dynamic analysis was performed using TE signals, and TE-based damage features were calculated from the processed TE signals to quantitatively represent health conditions. The procedures described aforesaid were then applied to a case study of a planetary gear in a wind turbine gear train. From the results, we conclude that TE signals can be used to detect the faults, while enhancing understanding of the complex dynamic behaviors of planetary gears.

AB Electrical condition monitoring (CM) normally involves the collection of high-frequency, instantaneous data for feature extraction. This paper presents a novel development of an electrical condition monitoring system for wind turbines. The system is developed based upon a control and data acquisition system, for which hardware modules can be configured for a particular set of signals, thus tailoring the system to a specific range of monitoring tasks. A wavelet-based singularity detection method is proposed, which automatically calculates the Lipschitz exponent, a measure to describe the local transient activities in the measurement signal. The relationship between the Lipschitz exponent and the type and severity of faults occurring on the grid and in the power electronics is explored. The proposed algorithms are tested and validated using simulation data from computer simulations of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbine with a grid connection. A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) embedded in the system has been utilised, allowing the signal processing tasks to be undertaken in real-time for monitoring purposes. The paper demonstrates that a fault signal of small magnitude generated at the early stage of a fault carries the same Lipschitz exponent as the signal of large magnitude generated at the late stage of the fault, thereby providing an early warning before the fault develops into a detrimental one.

AB A laboratory study is reported regarding fatigue damage growth monitoring in a complete 45.7 m long wind turbine blade typically designed for a 2 MW generator. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of in-service monitoring of the structural health of blades by acoustic emission (AE). Cyclic loading by compact resonant masses was performed to accurately simulate in-service load conditions and 187 kcs of fatigue were performed over periods which totalled 21 days, during which AE monitoring was performed with a 4 sensor array. Before the final 8 days of fatigue testing a simulated rectangular defect of dimensions 1 m x 0.05 m x 0.01 m was introduced into the blade material. The growth of fatigue damage from this source defect was successfully detected from AE monitoring. The AE signals were correlated with the growth of delamination up to 0.3 m in length and channel cracking in the final two days of fatigue testing. A high detection threshold of 40 dB was employed to suppress AE noise generated by the fatigue loading, which was a realistic simulation of the noise that would be generated in service from wind impact and acoustic coupling to the tower and nacelle. In order to decrease the probability of false alarm, a threshold of 45 dB was selected for further data processing. The crack propagation related AE signals discovered by counting only received pulse signals (bursts) from 4 sensors whose arrival times lay within the maximum variation of travel times from the damage source to the different sensors in the array. Analysis of the relative arrival times at the sensors by triangulation method successfully determined the location of damage growth, which was confirmed by photographic evidence. In view of the small scale of the damage growth relative to the blade size that was successfully detected, the developed AE monitoring methodology shows excellent promise as an in-service blade integrity monitoring technique capable of providing early warnings of developing damage before it becomes too expensive to repair.

AB This paper proposes advanced signal-processing techniques to improve condition monitoring of operating machines. The proposed methods use the results of a blind spectrum interpretation that includes harmonic and sideband series detection. The first contribution of this study is an algorithm for automatic association of harmonic and sideband series to characteristic fault frequencies according to a kinematic configuration. The approach proposed has the advantage of taking into account a possible slip of the rolling element bearings. In the second part, we propose a full-band demodulation process from all sidebands that are relevant to the spectral estimation. To do so, a multi-rate filtering process in an iterative schema provides satisfying precision and stability over the targeted demodulation band, even for unsymmetrical and extremely narrow bands. After synchronous averaging, the filtered signal is demodulated for calculation of the amplitude and frequency modulation functions, and then any features that indicate faults. Finally, the proposed algorithms are validated on vibration signals measured on a test rig that was designed as part of the European Innovation Project 'KAStrion'. This rig simulates a wind turbine drive train at a smaller scale. The data show the robustness of the method for localizing and extracting a fault on the main bearing. The evolution of the proposed features is a good indicator of the fault severity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, torsional vibration effects of a planetary gearbox on electrical signatures of a wound-rotor induction generator have been studied in a representative complex electromechanical system through both numerical simulations and experiments. A universal lumped-parameter model has been developed with consideration of impacts of main drive-train mechanical components. This model has been adapted to a reduced-scale wind turbine simulator based on a 5.5-kW three-phase wound-rotor induction generator used for experimental validation at different load conditions. For this system, it has been demonstrated that most of mechanical characteristic frequencies of the planetary gearbox are difficult to be identified in the stator current spectrum. Nevertheless, the proposed approach has been used as an initial stage to assess the effectiveness of noninvasive condition monitoring of a planetary gearbox based on electrical signatures analysis.

AB In this paper, a contribution to the development of low-cost wind turbine (WT) test rig for stator fault diagnosis of wind turbine generator is proposed. The test rig is developed using a 2.5 kW, 1750 RPM DC motor coupled to a 1.5 kW, 1500 RPM self-excited induction generator interfaced with a WT mathematical model in LabVIEW. The performance of the test rig is benchmarked with already proven wind turbine test rigs. In order to detect the stator faults using non-stationary signals in self-excited induction generator, an online fault diagnostic technique of DWT-based multi-resolution analysis is proposed. It has been experimentally proven that for varying wind conditions wavelet decomposition allows good differentiation between faulty and healthy conditions leading to an effective diagnostic procedure for wind turbine condition monitoring.

AB The dynamical characteristics research of planetary gear system with tooth pitting is useful for early fault diagnosis and monitor. However, it is an unsolved puzzle to establish the relationship between tooth pitting and dynamical characteristics. In this study, a pitting fault analytical model is proposed to investigate the effects of tooth pitting on the gear mesh stiffness. Then this mesh stiffness with tooth pitting is incorporated into a dynamical model of planetary gear system, and the effects of the tooth pitting on the vibration characteristics is investigated. The simulated results show that the time-varying mesh stiffness is reduced with tooth pitting propagations along width or depth direction. The mesh frequency and its harmonics are mainly frequencies components in the frequency spectrum of dynamic mesh force, but sidebands caused by the tooth pitting are more sensitive than the mesh frequency and its harmonics. The tooth pitting frequency and its harmonics also increase with the rising rotational speed of the sun gear. In addition, both relative statistical indicators of RMS and Kurtosis increase with the growth of tooth pitting size. But the relative indicators have different sensitivity on the vibration signal type. These results could supply some guidance to the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of planetary gear system, especially to the gear tooth pitting at early stage.

AB Wind farms are located in areas with a high probability of ice occurrence. Icing involves problems such as energy losses, mechanical failures and downtimes. The priority is to detect icing in order to avoid these problems.
   Icing detection is a complex procedure for example, low temperatures are not a guaranty of ice formation, and other variables may affect. Different techniques have been recently proposed to detect ice in wind turbine blades. They are mainly based on damping of ultrasonic waves on the blade surface, or measuring the resonant frequency of a probe. But these methods have some drawbacks that may cause the system to fail, e.g. the behaviour of ultrasonic waves in composite materials is difficult to predict due to different fibre orientations, and the ice detection by changes in the resonance frequency could lead to false alarms due to variations in working conditions.
   This paper takes advantage of the remote sensing techniques to propose a novel approach for icing detection without physical contact. The approach is based on the drastic emissivity change that it is produced over a surface characterized with a low emissivity value when ice appears. An experiment was conducted using a broad-band thermal radiometer and a section of a wind turbine blade. Radiometric temperature measurements were collected over the blade with and without an aluminium foil patch. The piece of blade was cooled down and different scenarios were considered, including frozen with and without ice. This study was completed with a sensitivity analysis of the approach to dust accumulation, accounting for real operation conditions. Results show the feasibility of this technique to detect ice formation and discern between frozen and icing conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The selection of most sensitive sensors and signal processing methods is essential process for the design of condition monitoring and intelligent fault diagnosis and prognostic systems. Normally, sensory data includes high level of noise and irrelevant or redundant information which makes the selection of the most sensitive sensor and signal processing method a difficult task. This paper introduces a new application of the Automated Sensor and Signal Processing Approach (ASPS), for the design of condition monitoring systems for developing an effective monitoring system for gearbox fault diagnosis. The approach is based on using Taguchi's orthogonal arrays, combined with automated selection of sensory characteristic features, to provide economically effective and optimal selection of sensors and signal processing methods with reduced experimental work. Multi-sensory signals such as acoustic emission, vibration, speed and torque are collected from the gearbox test rig under different health and operating conditions. Time and frequency domain signal processing methods are utilised to assess the suggested approach. The experiments investigate a single stage gearbox system with three level of damage in a helical gear to evaluate the proposed approach. Two different classification models are employed using neural networks to evaluate the methodology. The results have shown that the suggested approach can be applied to the design of condition monitoring systems of gearbox monitoring without the need for implementing pattern recognition tools during the design phase; where the pattern recognition can be implemented as part of decision making for diagnostics. The suggested system has a wide range of applications including industrial machinery as well as wind turbines for renewable energy applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID BAYESIAN PROCESS-CONTROL; MODELS; PRODUCTS; SUBJECT; SCHEME
AB In this paper, we present a new model to find the jointly optimal economic manufacturing quantity (EMQ) and preventive maintenance (PM) policy for a complex production facility. Unlike the previous joint models which dealt with EMQ and maintenance policy considering a single unit production facility and traditional maintenance approaches, we consider a production facility which consists of two modules with economic dependence. The more expensive module (unit 1) is subject to condition monitoring (CM), and only the age information of the second module (unit 2) is available, which follows a general distribution. The deterioration process of unit 1 is modeled as a continuous time hidden-Markov process. CM data is available at the end of each production run, and it provides only partial information about the hidden state of unit 1. The failure state of unit 1 is observable at any time. The objective is to develop a jointly optimal lot sizing and maintenance policy for a two-unit production facility using multivariate Bayesian control approach by minimizing the long-run expected average cost per unit time. The problem is formulated and solved in the semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) framework. Also, a formula for the mean residual life (MRL) of the production facility is derived, which is an important statistic for practical applications. A practical example of the wind turbine CM and maintenance is provided and a comparison with other policies shows an outstanding performance of the new model and the control policy proposed in this paper.

ID LIFE-CYCLE COSTS; ISSUES
AB Reliability, availability, maintainability and safety (RAMS) of wind turbines in cold climates are closely related to ice accretion. The deterioration of RAMS of the wind turbines involves costs such as Operation and Maintenance costs and energy losses. Systems to monitor the condition of the wind turbines play a key role in the wind energy industry to decrease the costs mentioned above and to improve the maintenance management. This research presents an economic study of the life cycle cost (LCC) for ice condition monitoring systems in wind turbines. In particular, the paper studies the economic feasibility of different commercial ice detection systems through a LCC model when wind turbines are exposed to different scenarios. To date, the scientific literature does not collect any study about the LCC for ice detection systems using different annual rates of return, and providing a map with numerical solution. The study is extended by including a bank loan for a real point of view. The findings of this study reveal the ice detection systems that are more profitable and the selection criteria to decide the use of a bank loan. Finally, it is shown that predictive costs are much smaller than corrective cost reaching a reduction of these corrective costs with the ice detection systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

ID STRUCTURAL DAMAGE; FREQUENCY; ALGORITHM
AB Condition monitoring (CM) of wind turbine blades has significant benefits for wind farm operators and insurers alike. Blades present a particular challenge in terms of operations and maintenance: the wide range of materials used in their construction makes it difficult to predict lifetimes; loading is stochastic and highly variable; and access can be problematic due to the remote locations where turbines are frequently located, particularly for offshore installations. Whilst previous works have indicated that Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) accelerometers are viable devices for measuring the vibrations from which diagnostic information can be derived, thus far there has been no analysis of how such a system would be powered. This paper considers the power requirement of a self-powered blade-tip autonomous system and how those requirements can be met. The radio link budget is derived for the system and the average power requirement assessed. Following this, energy harvesting methods such as photovoltaics, vibration, thermal and radio frequency (RF) are explored. Energy storage techniques and energy regulation for the autonomous system are assessed along with their relative merits. It is concluded that vibration (piezoelectric) energy harvesting combined with lithium-ion batteries are suitable selections for such a system. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Availability and reliability are among the priority concerns for deployment of distributed generation (DG) systems, particularly when operating in a harsh environment. Condition monitoring (CM) can meet the requirement but has been challenged by large amounts of data needing to be processed in real time due to the large number of sensors being deployed. This paper proposes an optimal sensor selection method based on principal component analysis (PCA) for condition monitoring of a DG system oriented to wind turbines. The research was motivated by the fact that salient patterns in multivariable datasets can be extracted by PCA in order to identify monitoring parameters that contribute the most to the system variation. The proposed method is able to correlate the particular principal component to the corresponding monitoring variable, and hence facilitate the right sensor selection for the first time for the condition monitoring of wind turbines. The algorithms are examined with simulation data from PSCAD/EMTDC and SCADA data from an operational wind farm in the time, frequency, and instantaneous frequency domains. The results have shown that the proposed technique can reduce the number of monitoring variables whilst still maintaining sufficient information to detect the faults and hence assess the system's conditions.

AB Oil debris signals are applied to monitor lubricant oil conditions and fault diagnosis of a wind turbine. However, the signals will be influenced by the vibration of transmission mechanism and background noise, hence false alarms and undetected particles will limit sensors ability in examining fine particles in oil debris. This paper presents an approach to enhance the performance of oil debris signals. The de-noising of signals used a wavelet filtering to remove the vibration of a wind turbine, and then set a threshold to remove the background noise which caused by the system of measurement. The effectiveness of this enhanced measurement system is tested by using simulated and experimental signals.

AB Frequency methods such as frequency spectrum analysis, frequency spike detection, demodulation, envelope spectrum method have been widely used for condition monitoring of engineering structural systems. Different from the conventional frequency methods, the transmissibility function (TF) represents the relationship between different system output responses such as, e.g., vibration and acoustic emission sensor measurements. This paper introduces a simple and effective generalized transmissibility damage indicator (GTDI) for TF-based condition monitoring. Unlike the conventional transmissibility damage indicator, the new GTDI can improve the detection sensitivity, reduces noise effects and avoid dynamic loadings effects. This is achieved by combining multiple groups of data to obtain more accurate transmissibility analysis, exploiting all the available TFs, and using multiple references. This has two advantages. First, it does not require any other priori knowledge about the system responses. Therefore, the method can be used for the condition monitoring of a wide range of components or systems. Furthermore, the method can be easily implemented using fast Fourier transform or power spectra density methods and therefore is computationally efficient. These make the method very suitable for implementing online real-time condition monitoring. The method is investigated by simulation studies and then applied to analyze the vibration data of the main bearing of operating wind turbines, producing very promising results.

AB Performance monitoring of offshore wind turbines is an essential first step in the condition monitoring process. This paper provides three novelties regarding power curve modeling. The first consists of illustrating that univariate power curve modeling can be improved by the use of non-parametric methods such as stochastic gradient boosted regression trees, extremely randomized forest, random forest, K-nearest neighbors, and the method of bins according to the IEC standard 61,400-12-1. This is confirmed on both a synthetic data set and a real live data set containing data from three offshore wind turbines. The second novelty consists of an improvement regarding overall power curve modeling results by the use of multivariate models which incorporate the wind direction, rotations per minute of the rotor, yaw, wind direction and pitch additional to the wind speed. The best improvement is achieved by the stochastic gradient boosted regression trees method for which the mean absolute error can be decreased by up to 27.66%. The third novelty consists of making a synthetic data set available for bench-marking purposes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main drivers for the development and evolution of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are the reduction of development costs and time along with the enhancement of the designed products. The aim of this survey paper is to provide an overview of different types of system and the associated transition process from mechatronics to CPS and cloud-based (IoT) systems. It will further consider the requirement that methodologies for CPS-design should be part of a multi-disciplinary development process within which designers should focus not only on the separate physical and computational components, but also on their integration and interaction. Challenges related to CPS-design are therefore considered in the paper from the perspectives of the physical processes, computation and integration respectively. Illustrative case studies are selected from different system levels starting with the description of the overlaying concept of Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). The analysis and evaluation of the specific properties of a sub-system using a condition monitoring system, important for the maintenance purposes, is then given for a wind turbine.

ID PART I
AB Effective wind turbine fault diagnostic algorithms are crucial for wind turbine intelligent condition monitoring. An unscented Kalman filter approach is proposed to successfully detect and isolate two types of gearbox failures of a wind turbine in this paper. The state space models are defined for the unscented Kalman filter model by a detailed wind turbine nonlinear systematic principle analysis. The three failure modes being studied are gearbox damage, lubrication oil leakage and pitch failure. The results show that unscented Kalman filter model has special response to online input parameters under different fault conditions. Such property makes it effective on fault identification. It also shows that properly defining unscented Kalman filter state space vectors and control vectors are crucial for improving its sensitivity to different failures. Online fault detection capability of this approach is then proved on SCADA data. The developed unsented Kalman filter model provides an effective way for wind turbine fault detection using supervisory control and data acquisition data. This is essential for further intelligent WT condition monitoring.

AB Condition monitoring (CM), fault diagnosis (FD), and nondestructive testing (NDT) are currently considered crucialmeans to increase the reliability and availability of wind turbines. Many research works have focused on CM and FDfor different components of wind turbine. Gear is typically used in a wind turbine. There is insufficient space to locate the sensors for long-term monitoring of fatigue state of gear, thus, offline inspection using NDT in both manufacturing and maintenance processes are critically important. This paper proposes an inductive thermography method for gear inspection. The ability to track the properties variation in gear such as electrical conductivity, magnetic permeability, and thermal conductivity has promising potential for the evaluation of material state undertaken by contact fatigue. Conventional thermography characterization methods are built based on single physical field analysis such as heat conduction or in-plane eddy current field. This study develops a physics-based multidimensional spatial-transientstage tensor model to describe the thermo optical flow pattern for evaluating the contact fatigue damage. A helical gear with different cycles of contact fatigue tests was investigated and the proposed method was verified. It indicates that the proposed methods are effective tool for gear inspection and fatigue evaluation, which is important for early warning and condition-based maintenance.

ID MODEL
AB Ice accretion on wind turbines' blades is one of the main challenges of systems installed in cold climate locations, resulting in power performance deterioration and excessive nacelle oscillation. In this work, consistent detection of icing events is achieved utilizing indications from the nacelle accelerometers and power performance analysis. Features extracted from these two techniques serve as inputs in a decision-making scheme, allowing early activation of de-icing systems or shut down of the wind turbine. An additional parameter is the month of operation, assuring consistent outcomes in both winter and summer seasons. The amplitude of lateral nacelle vibration at rotor speed is the used condition indicator from vibration standpoint, which is verified by the presence of sinusoidal shape in high-resolution time waveforms. Employment of k-nearest neighbour on wind speed - power production data sets leads to successful recognition of power performance deterioration. Results from one wind park consisting of 13 turbines operating under icing are presented, where similar patterns on both vibration and power curve data validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the reliable detection of icing formation.

AB The intend of this paper is to give a description of the realization of a low-cost wind turbine emulator (WTE) with open source technology from graze required for the condition monitoring to diagnose rotor and stator faults in a wind turbine generator (WTG). The WTE comprises of a 2.5 kW DC motor coupled with a 1 kW squirrel-cage induction machine. This paper provides a detailed overview of the hardware and software used along with the WTE control strategies such as MPPT and pitch control. The emulator reproduces dynamic characteristics both under step variations and arbitrary variation in the wind speed of a typical wind turbine (WT) of a wind energy conversion system (WECS). The usefulness of the setup has been benchmarked with previously verified WT test rigs made at the University of Manchester and Durham University in UK. Considering the fact that the rotor blades and electric subassemblies direct drive WTs are most susceptible to damage in practice, generator winding faults and rotor unbalance have been introduced and investigated using the terminal voltage and generated current. This wind turbine emulator (WTE) can be reconfigured or analyzed for condition monitoring without the need for real WTs.

AB Planetary gearboxes (PGBs) are widely used in the drivetrain of wind turbines. Any PGB failure could lead to a significant breakdown or major loss of a wind turbine. Therefore, PGB fault diagnosis is very important for reducing the downtime and maintenance cost and improving the safety, reliability, and lifespan of wind turbines. The wind energy industry currently utilizes vibratory analysis as a standard method for PGB condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Among them, the vibration separation is considered as one of the well-established vibratory analysis techniques. However, the drawbacks of the vibration separation technique as reported in the literature include the following: potential sun gear fault diagnosis limitation, multiple sensors and large data requirement, and vulnerability to external noise. This paper presents a new method using a single vibration sensor for PGB fault diagnosis using spectral averaging. It combines the techniques of enveloping, Welch's spectral averaging, and data mining-based fault classifiers. Using the presented approach, vibration fault features for wind turbine PGB are extracted as condition indicators for fault diagnosis and condition indicators are used as inputs to fault classifiers for PGB fault diagnosis. The method is validated on a set of seeded localized faults on all gears: sun gear, planetary gear, and ring gear. The results have shown a promising PGB fault diagnosis performance with the presented method. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Battery-powered wireless sensor networks have been extensively deployed in condition monitoring and structural health monitoring systems, but the performance of wireless sensors are limited by battery capacity and difficulty of application in rotating machines. In this paper, a variety of commercial wireless charging solutions and coil-shaft configurations for magnetic coupling are compared, having in mind of the application of continuously charging wireless sensors on rotating machines. For the co-axial configuration of the transmitter coil and the receiver coil, a Qi standard compliant wireless charging kit and a custom charging circuit are successfully applied to charge wireless sensors on small rotating test rigs. In order to harvest and store intermittent energy input from the wireless power source, a prototype receiver circuit using a supercapacitor and low-dropout regulator is designed and validated. Based on the prototype circuit, the radial configuration of single transmitter coil and multiple receiver coils is demonstrated for wireless power transfer to the sensor nodes on the drivetrain of a small wind turbine test rig.

AB Wind energy has become one of the leading sources of renewable energy, but faults and unscheduled shutdowns of wind turbines are costly. As the size and number of wind turbines continue to rise, monitoring for faults has become increasingly important for companies to remain competitive. This paper presents a three-phase methodology to detect emerging faults and to possibly reduce the number of unscheduled shutdowns. The first phase monitors the wind turbine online by constructing residual control charts for the turbine's power curve. Type I errors or type II errors are identified in this phase to avoid false warnings if an unusually high number of observations outside the control limits are present. Given the control charts, the second phase uses autoassociative neural networks (AANNs) to detect anomalous components by comparing the mean square errors (MSEs) of the components. The third phase generates a schedule chart consisting of an anomalous schedule, a preventive schedule, and an ideal schedule. The objective of the schedule chart is to enhance the turbine's productivity by reducing the number of unexpected shutdowns, with the aim to eventually eliminate them.

AB Condition monitoring, fault diagnosis and Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) are an essential part of predictive maintenance. In order to provide early warning of damage, wireless sensor nodes are located at structures, which are often in hostile and hard to access environments. Therefore, there is a need of using sensor nodes with low power signal conditioning electronics, wide range measurement, synchronous data acquisition and reliable signal transmission within large scale-networks.
   The sensor nodes developed in this work contain a transducer, a signal conditioning circuit and a signal processing software, and are powered by a small rechargeable lithium-ion polymer battery. The signal conditioning circuit is generic and configurable, enabling the conditioning of accelerometers and strain gages, and the signal acquisition of the nodes is performed through wireless synchronized communication.
   The performance of the presented device is demonstrated for SHM of wind turbines. The commonly used system for SHM of wind turbines is installed during the construction of the structure and consists of wired sensors connected to a central data acquisition unit via cables. In this respect, the system developed in this work, which forms a wireless sensor network (WSN) for SHM, is compared to the commonly used system for SHM of wind turbines. The developed WSN offers two main advantages with respect to commonly used systems for SHM: installation and maintenance cost, and time, high reduction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wireless networks are regarded as a promising candidate for condition monitoring systems of large-scale wind turbines due to the design flexibility, easy deployment, and reduced installation cost. This article investigates different data aggregation approaches of wireless-based architectures for the internal monitoring of a large-scale wind turbine. The main objective is to construct a wireless internal network inside the wind turbine nacelle, for collecting sensing data from different parts and transmitting the data to a remote control center through a wireless external network that serves the turbine towers of the wind farm. The proposed wireless network architectures consist of wireless sensor nodes, coordinator nodes, and a front-end device. The designs of the wireless-based architectures involve choices of physical components, sensor types, sampling rate, and data rate. Wi-Fi is a promising technology that is considered for the wind turbine internal network in this work. Through simulations, the network performance is evaluated with regard to end-to-end delay for different data aggregation approaches of wireless-based architectures.

ID MODEL
AB It has been observed that a large variability exists between wind speed and wind power in real metrological conditions. To reduce this substantial variability, this study developed a stochastic wind turbine power curve by incorporating various exogenous factors. Four measurements, namely, wind azimuth, wind elevation, air density and solar radiation are chosen as exogenous influence factors. A recursive formula based on conditional copulas is used to capture the complex dependency structure between wind speed and wind power with reduced variability. A procedure of selecting a proper form for each factor and its corresponding copula models is given. Through a case study on the small wind turbine located in southeast of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, we demonstrate that the variability can be reduced significantly by incorporating these influence factors. Wind turbine operators can apply the method reported in this study to construct a stochastic power curve for local wind farms and use it to achieve more accurate power forecasting and health condition monitoring of the turbine.

AB This study determines the early deterioration condition of critical components for a wind turbine generator system (WTGS). Due to the uncertainty nature of the fluctuation and intermittence of wind, early deterioration condition evaluation poses a challenge to the traditional vibration-based condition monitoring methods. Considering the its thermal inertia and strong anti-interference capacity, temperature characteristic parameters as a deterioration indication cannot be adequately disturbed by the uncontrollable noise and uncertainty nature of wind. This paper provides a probability evaluation method of early deterioration condition for critical components based only on temperature characteristic parameters. First, the dynamic threshold of deterioration degree function was proposed by analyzing the operational data between temperature and rotor speed. Second, a probability evaluation method of early deterioration condition was presented. Finally, two cases showed the validity of the proposed probability evaluation method in detecting early deterioration condition and in tracking their further deterioration for the critical components.

DE Rolling element bearings; Varying operational conditions; Generalized

AB Vibration-based condition monitoring of rotary machinery develops toward application for highly non stationary operational conditions, mainly rotational speed and load. If speed and load vary during the acquisition of vibration signal, both, instantaneous amplitudes and instantaneous frequencies of signal components vary accordingly. This scenario causes a strong demand for novel signal processing approach suitable for analysis of such processes. In this paper, angular-temporal spectrum is introduced as a novel and practical solution for analysis of such signals. The tool is based on well-established principles of angular-temporal determinism, and allows for representation of energy of analyzed signal on bi-frequency plane related to angular and temporal properties of the signal. Additionally, proposed approach includes amplitude normalization technique in order to give more interpretable measures of amplitude related to varying speed and load. The paper gives overall description of the proposed tool as well as its intuitive explanation from the perspective of signal generation mechanism. The outcome of the angular-temporal spectrum is presented using generated signal, vibration signal measured on lab test-rig operating with damaged bearing during run-up process, and finally on industrial data from a wind turbine.

AB Although Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) wind turbines (WTs) mitigate gearbox impacts, they requires high reliability of generators and converters. Statistical analysis shows that the failure rate of direct-drive PMSG wind turbines' generators and inverters are high. Intelligent fault diagnosis algorithms to detect inverters faults is a premise for the condition monitoring system aimed at improving wind turbines' reliability and availability. The influences of random wind speed and diversified control strategies lead to challenges for developing intelligent fault diagnosis algorithms for converters. This paper studies open-circuit fault features of wind turbine converters in variable wind speed situations through systematic simulation and experiment. A new fault diagnosis algorithm named Wind Speed Based Normalized Current Trajectory is proposed and used to accurately detect and locate faulted IGBT in the circuit arms. It is compared to direct current monitoring and current vector trajectory pattern approaches. The results show that the proposed method has advantages in the accuracy of fault diagnosis and has superior anti-noise capability in variable wind speed situations. The impact of the control strategy is also identified. Experimental results demonstrate its applicability on practical WT condition monitoring system which is used to improve wind turbine reliability and reduce their maintenance cost.

AB This paper presents fault detection techniques in an attempt to discriminate between two common faults in axial-flux permanent magnet wind generators namely; static eccentricities and interturn short circuit faults. A combination of condition monitoring systems is proposed to achieve the discrimination; with detection techniques derived from current and vibration signatures for both faults using signal processing techniques. Parametric spectral estimation technique is applied as an alternative to the Fourier transform to process the fault signatures. This effectively overcame the problem of non-stationarity of signals due to variable wind speed as high frequency resolution was attained with less than three seconds of measurement data. The results will advance the development of standards and technical guidelines in the condition monitoring of permanent magnet synchronous generators in wind turbines. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB A noise suppression method for feature frequency extraction that is supplemented with multi-point data fusion was investigated in consideration of issues involving wind turbine vibration signals subject to high noise disturbance. The difficulty of extracting early weak fault features was examined as well. First, a de-noising and feature extraction method that uses EMD-Correlation was developed by adding empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and autocorrelation de-noising to the wavelet package transform under the effects of white noise and short-term disturbance noise in wind turbine vibration signals. Second, an EMD-Correlation analysis model for feature frequency extraction supplemented with multi-point data fusion was established with reference to adaptive resonance theory-2 to highlight the feature frequency of a possible early weak fault. Third, the results obtained with the actual and simulated fault vibration signals of wind turbine bearing faults and the outcomes of comparing the different feature frequency extraction methods show that the proposed method of EMD-Correlation that is supplemented with multi-point data fusion can not only effectively reduce white noise and short-term disturbance noise but can also extract the feature frequency of early weak faults. Finally, prototype hardware and software were developed for a wind turbine condition monitoring system based on the aforementioned fault feature extraction algorithms and tested in an actual wind turbine generation system.

AB Small wind turbines are often used in remote locations, making them difficult and expensive to repair. This suggests the need for remote condition monitoring and fault diagnosis which has not been used extensively for small turbines. In order to investigate small direct drive wind turbine generators working at variable speed and develop new condition monitoring and fault diagnosis techniques, a test facility based on a 500W permanent magnet generator was built. The investigation concentrated on mechanical faults which include ball bearing outer race defect and a rotor imbalance. Electrical load imbalance was also investigated. Imbalance detection was performed through wavelet power spectrum analysis of vibration signals. Three time-frequency analysis techniques were performed on vibration signals and performances are compared. These were short time Fourier transforms, continuous wavelet transform, and order analysis. Order analysis proved to be a simple, intuitive, and reliable technique for vibration analysis under variable speed.

AB This paper proposes and investigates the application of the gradient heat flux sensor (GHFS) for measuring the local heat flux in power electronics. Thanks to its thinness, the sensor can be placed between the semiconductor module and the heat sink. The GHFS has high sensitivity and yields direct measurements without an interruption to the normal power device operation, which makes it attractive for power electronics applications. The development of systems for monitoring thermal loading and methods for online detection of degradation and failure of power electronic devices is a topical and crucial task. However, online condition monitoring (CM) methods, which include heat flux sensors, have received little research attention so far. In the current research, an insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) module-based test setup with the GHFS implemented on the base plate of one of the IGBTs is introduced. The heat flux experiments and the IGBT power losses obtained by simulations show similar results. The findings give clear evidence that the GHFS can provide an attractive condition monitoring method for the thermal loading of power devices.

AB Wind turbines (WTs) are designed to operate under extreme environmental conditions. This means that extreme and varying loads experienced by WT components need to be accounted for as well as gaining access to wind farms (WFs) at different times of the year. Condition monitoring (CM) is used by WF owners to assess WT health by detecting gearbox failures and planning for operations and maintenance (O&M). However, there are several challenges and limitations with commercially available CM technologies ranging from the cost of installing monitoring systems to the ability to detect faults accurately. This study seeks to address some of these challenges by developing novel techniques for fault detection using the RMS and Extreme (peak) values of vibration signals. The proposed techniques are based on three models (signal correlation, extreme vibration, and RMS intensity) and have been validated with a time domain data driven approach using CM data of operational WTs. The findings of this study show that monitoring RMS and Extreme values serves as a leading indicator for early detection of faults using Extreme value theory, giving WF owners time to schedule O&M. Furthermore, it also indicates that the prediction accuracy of each CM technique depends on the physics of failure. This suggests that an approach which incorporates the strengths of multiple techniques is needed for holistic health assessment of WT components. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   Time-domain-signals; Wind energy converter
AB Currently, condition monitoring of gearboxes mainly relies on signals of mechanical vibrations (mostly acceleration; fewer velocity and distance) or very high-frequency acoustic emissions as well as oil particle and temperature data. Strains are rarely used, since the common measuring technique employing strain gauges can cause problems in harsh environmental conditions.
   In the following, time-domain signals of robust piezoelectric strain sensors applied on the surface of the ring gear of a gearbox are analyzed regarding their mechanical basics, measurement chains and inferable information. The gearbox specimen is a main gearbox of a wind energy converter (WEC), which is deployed on a WEC system test rig. It can be shown that the surface strain on fixed ring gears in tangential direction is mainly influenced by the transferred tooth forces between planets and ring gear but also by the stiffnesses and geometries of the ring gear itself and the supporting gearbox structure. A direct comparison of sensor connection in AC- and DC-coupling shows that with the utilized piezoelectric sensors in DC-coupling surface strain signals with very low frequencies down to 0.002 Hz can be obtained. The acquired signals show a very high signal to-noise-ratio and high repeatability even at very low revolution speeds. Furthermore a direct correlation to the dynamic torque, which is transferred by the gearbox, and to the planetary load sharing is found. (C) 2 015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Some system parameters in mechanical systems are always uncertain due to uncertainties in geometric and material properties, lubrication condition and wear. For a more reasonable estimation of dynamic analysis of the parametrically excited system, the effect of uncertain parameters should be taken into account. This paper presents a new non-probabilistic analysis method for solving the dynamic responses of parametrically excited systems under uncertainties and multi-frequency excitations. By using the multidimensional harmonic balance method (MHBM) and the Chebyshev inclusion function (CIF), an interval multi-dimensional harmonic balance method (IMHBM) is obtained. To illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method, a time-varying geared system of wind turbine with different kinds of uncertainties is demonstrated. By comparing with the results of the scanning method, it is shown that the presented method is valid and effective for the parametrically excited system with uncertainties and multi-frequency excitations. The effects of some uncertain system parameters including uncertain mesh stiffnesses and uncertain bearing stiffnesses on the frequency responses of the system are also discussed in detail. It is shown that the dynamic responses of the system are insensitive to the uncertain mesh stiffness and bearing stiffnesses of the planetary gear stage. The uncertain bearing stiffnesses of the intermediate and high-speed stages will lead to relatively large uncertainties in the dynamic responses around resonant regions. It will provide valuable guidance for the optimal design and condition monitoring of wind turbine gearboxes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Data collected from the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system are used widely in wind farms to obtain operation and performance information about wind turbines. The paper presents a three-way model by means of parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) for wind turbine fault detection and sensor selection, and evaluates the method with SCADA data obtained from an operational farm. The main characteristic of this new approach is that it can be used to simultaneously explore measurement sample profiles and sensors profiles to avoid discarding potentially relevant information for feature extraction. With K-means clustering method, the measurement data indicating normal, fault and alarm conditions of the wind turbines can be identified, and the sensor array can be optimised for effective condition monitoring.

AB A data-driven model based on Bayesian classifiers and multivariate analysis of the power curve (wind speed vs. power) for monitoring wind farms' performance is presented. A new outlier detection criterion and various control bounds on the skewness and kurtosis of the data for cluster separation and classification of turbines' faulty and normal state of operation are introduced. Further continuous monitoring is addressed with Hotelling's T-2 and Bayesian network approaches, and it is proven that under certain conditions, the outcomes of these two methods are equivalent. The Bayesian approach, however addresses the likelihood of classification, making supervised controls more flexible. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents an asset model for offshore wind turbine reliability accounting for the degradation, inspection and maintenance processes. The model was developed based on the Petri net method that effectively captures the stochastic nature of the dynamic processes through the use of appropriate statistical distributions. The versatility of the method allows the details of the degradation and maintenance operations to be incorporated in the model. In particular, there are dependent deterioration processes between wind turbine subsystems, complex maintenance rules and the incorporation of condition monitoring systems for early failure indication to enable replacement prior to failure. The purposes of the model are to predict the future condition of wind turbine components and to investigate the effect of a specified maintenance strategy. The model outputs are statistics indicating the performance of the wind turbine components; these include the probability of being in different condition states, the expected number of maintenance actions and the average number and duration of system downtime under any maintenance strategy.

AB The implementation of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis system (CMFDS) on wind turbine is significant to lower the unscheduled breakdown. Generator is one of the most important components in wind turbine, and generator bearing fault identification always draws lots of attention. However, non stationary vibration signal of weak fault and compound fault with a large amount of background noise makes this task challenging in many cases. So, effective signal processing method is essential in the accurate diagnosis step of CMFDS. As a novel signal processing method, empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) is used to extract inherent modulation information by decomposing signal into mono components under an orthogonal basis, which is seen as a powerful tool for mechanical fault diagnosis. Moreover, in order to avoid the inaccurate identification the internal modes caused by the heavy noise, wavelet spatial neighboring coefficient denoising with data-driven threshold is applied to increase Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) before EWT. The effectiveness of the proposed technique on weak fault and compound fault diagnosis is first validated by two experimental cases. Finally, the proposed method has been applied to identify fault feature of generator bearing on wind turbine in wind farm successfully. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Condition monitoring of wind turbine gearboxes has mainly relied upon vibration, oil analysis and temperature monitoring. However, these techniques are not well suited for detecting early stage damage. Acoustic emission is gaining ground as a complementary condition monitoring technique as it offers earlier fault detection capability compared with other more established techniques. The objective of early fault detection in wind turbine gearboxes is to avoid unexpected catastrophic breakdowns, thereby reducing maintenance costs and increase safety. The aim of this investigation is to present an experimental study the impact of operational conditions (load and torque) in the acoustic emission activity generated within the wind turbine gearbox. The acoustic emission signature for a healthy wind turbine gearbox was obtained as a function of torque and power output, for the full range of operational conditions. Envelope analysis was applied to the acoustic emission signals to investigate repetitive patterns and correlate them with specific gearbox components. The analysis methodology presented herewith can be used for the reliable assessment of wind turbine gearbox subcomponents using acoustic emission.

SO MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING

DE Wind turbine; Planetary gearbox; Condition monitoring; Signal isolation;
   Time synchronous averaging (TSA)
ID DOMAIN; VIBRATION; GEARS
AB We propose autocorrelation-based time synchronous averaging (ATSA) to cope with the challenges associated with the current practice of time synchronous averaging (TSA) for planet gears in planetary gearboxes of wind turbine (WT). An autocorrelation function that represents physical interactions between the ring, sun, and planet gears in the gearbox is utilized to define the optimal shape and range of the window function for TSA using actual kinetic responses. The proposed ATSA offers two distinctive features: (1) data-efficient TSA processing and (2) prevention of signal distortion during the TSA process. It is thus expected that an order analysis with the ATSA signals significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy in fault diagnostics of planet gears in planetary gearboxes. Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method: an analytical signal from a simulation and a signal measured from a 2 kW WT testbed. It can be concluded from the results that the proposed method outperforms conventional TSA methods in condition monitoring of the planetary gearbox when the amount of available stationary data is limited.

TI Identification of critical components of wind turbines using FTA over

SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
LA English
DT Article

   monitoring; Maintenance management
AB Wind energy is currently the most widely implemented renewable energy source in global scale. Complex industrial multi-MW wind turbines are continuously being installed both onshore and offshore. Projects involving utility-scale wind turbines require optimisation of reliability, availability, maintainability and safety, in order to guarantee the financial viability of large scale wind energy projects, particularly offshore, in the forthcoming years. For this reason, critical wind turbine components must be identified and monitored as cost-effectively, reliably and efficiently as possible. The condition of industrial wind turbines can be qualitatively evaluated through the Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). The quantitative analysis requires high computational cost. In this paper, the Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) method is proposed for reducing this computational cost. In order to optimise the BDD a set of ranking methods of events has been considered; Level, Top-Down-Left-Right, AND, Depth First Search and Breadth-First Search. A quantitative analysis approach in order to find a general solution of a Fault Tree (FT) is presented. An illustrative case study of a FT of a wind turbine based on different research studies has been developed. Finally, this FT has been solved dynamically through the BDD approach in order to highlight the identification of the critical components of the wind turbine under different conditions, employing the following heuristic methods: Birnbaum, Criticality, Structural and Fussell-Vesely. The results provided by this methodology allow the performance of novel maintenance planning from a quantitative point of view. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel architecture and system for the provision of Reliability Centred Maintenance (RCM) for offshore wind power generation is presented. The architecture was developed by conducting a bottom-up analysis of the data required to support RCM within this specific industry, combined with a top-down analysis of the required maintenance functionality. The architecture and system consists of three integrated modules for intelligent condition monitoring, reliability and maintenance modelling, and maintenance scheduling that provide a scalable solution for performing dynamic, efficient and cost-effective preventative maintenance management within this extremely demanding renewable energy generation sector. The system demonstrates for the first time the integration of state-of-the-art advanced mathematical techniques: Random Forests, dynamic Bayesian networks and memetic algorithms in the development of an intelligent autonomous solution. The results from the application of the intelligent integrated system illustrated the automated detection of faults within a wind farm consisting of over 100 turbines, the modelling and updating of the turbines' survivability and creation of a hierarchy of maintenance actions, and the optimizing of the maintenance schedule with a view to maximizing the availability and revenue generation of the turbines.

AB Online monitoring and fault diagnosis technology can reduce maintenance costs, for improve the operational reliability have great value. With the rapid development of new energy technologies, this paper takes the wind turbine pitch system as the research object. Used the supervisory control and data acquisition(SCADA) system as experimental data, which stored in the database. The SCADA system dates presence of large number of similar samples, So in this paper eliminate the redundant information data based on the similarity function. Then using the method of nonlinear state assessment techniques established the pitch system NSET health model use the normal operation dates. when the device in normal operation, the residuals between the actual values and the predict of the model within the threshold range. when the system in abnormal operation, the residuals between the actual value and the predicted value of the model exceeds the threshold range. The actual verification shows that the NSET model can accurately identification the fault, thereby improved the new energy of safety and economy.

DE Synchrosqueezing; Joint Time-Frequency Representation; Wavelet; Non
   Stationary
AB In Wind turbine condition monitoring systems, the vibration signal analysis is used as the effective tool for fault diagnosis. Gear transmission systems are complex and expensive among the drive train components. Faults developed in the gearbox will lead to unscheduled down time of wind turbine. Vibration signals are non stationary in nature and the usual spectral analysis tools are not sufficient for the effective fault diagnosis. In this paper, A novel joint time-frequency Wavelet synchrosqueezing transform (WSST) is proposed for the effective intrinsic modes extraction. WSST provides fine Time-Frequency resolution. To improve the performance of WSST towards noise sensitivity, Wavelet Denoising with soft thresholding is employed. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is tested with the NERL GRC Wind Turbine condition monitoring benchmark datasets. From the simulation results, it has been shown that the proposed method extracts the intrinsic mode functions with more precise time frequency resolution.

AB Wind power generation is a renewable energy which has a big development potential. It has been paid attention worldwide in recent years. Condition monitoring of wind turbine large equipment become an important component of wind power research field. A new data visualization method based on Random Forest is proposed in this paper. It clearly demonstrates the structure of data distribution that makes the visualization of wind turbine condition monitoring data intuitive and interactive. Firstly, the condition monitoring data of wind turbines was similarly measured by Random Forest. Secondly, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is presented to make the characteristic transformation and dimension reduction for the monitoring data of wind turbines. Finally, the processed data in low dimensional space of wind turbines is displayed by data visualization; the display is shown as a scatterplot and parallel coordinates figure. Actual data from monitoring the conditions of wind turbines shows data visualization based on Random Forest enhances interactivity and makes the condition monitoring of wind turbines more intuitive, which makes it easy to determine the distribution rule and relationship between attributes for the wind turbines manager. At the same time, the running reliability of wind turbines is improved.

AB W Power curve (PC) monitoring can be applied to evaluate the wind turbine generator (WTG) power output and detect deviations between the expected and the measured value, often a precursor of unexpected faults. In this research, the instantaneous SCADA data is used to show the fault forecast ability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based PC monitoring of a pitch regulated WTG. The measured PCs illustrate that the instantaneous data is better than averaged data, widely used in the literature, to present the dynamics of WTG operation. The influence of ambient temperature, generator speed and pitch angle on WTG power output is analyzed using measured data. The analysis illustrates that the generator speed and pitch angle have a significant effect on WTG power generation. The performance of the proposed model option is compared against previously published option using the same data sets collected from a 2 MW Pitch Regulated WTG. The comparison is based on the mean absolute error (MAE), the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the correlation coefficient (R-2). The result shows that models considering generator speed and pitch angle performs better with lowest MAE and RMSE and highest R-2 values. A case study illustrated that the AI models, using wind speed, generator speed and pitch angle inputs, would have successfully detected a pitch fault due to the slip ring malfunction nearly 5 hours earlier than the existing fault detection mechanisms.

AB Despite new efforts to improve wind turbine (WT) reliability are constantly made in every subsystem of the Megawatt large WTs, small wind turbines (SWT) lack of reliability and Conditioning Monitoring (CM), probably due to economic considerations. Here, an analysis of field test data for a self-made SWT with a direct drive, slot-less, concentrated winding, Axial Flux Permanent-Magnet Generator (AFPMG) is presented. A broken blade fault event is also analyzed and a simple condition monitoring algorithm using the dc bus signals is proposed. This analysis shows that the mechanical nature of the described fault makes a slow sampling rate algorithm suitable for CM systems for SWTs.

AB This paper deals with wind turbine condition monitoring in non-stationary conditions. It seeks the construction of relevant indicator databases for the optimal exploitation of Instantaneous Angular Speed information (IAS). The procedure is based on IAS signal processing tools, indicator transformation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) classification tools. Experimental signals were collected over long operating periods from healthy and defective machines. Suitable IAS processing techniques have then been specifically developed for the extraction of a first set of indicators. Based on the latter, two transformation approaches were applied for the generation of new indicator databases. To evaluate the performance of the new sets of indicators the Radial Basis Neural Network classification method was applied over the raw and transformed databases. These analysis allowed us to assess the effectiveness of the current approach.

AB The application of decision making knowledge based methods is to analyze the system and identify its indepth diagnosis and fault behavior by simulating the expert knowledge from a similar domain. Rule based systems with predefined conditions have been replaced and or upgraded to expert knowledge based systems and further replaced / upgraded by applying machine learning techniques wherein, association rules, reasoning and decision making processes have been considered similar to expert knowledge in resolution of diagnostics during critical scenarios.
   The application of condition monitoring technique has been widely applied to analyze the behavior pattern of the system. In this paper, vibration signal analysis is performed to study and extract the behavioral pattern of the bearings. Further, machine learning models such as k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Means have been applied to classify the type of fault. Further, Collaborative Recommendation Approach (CRA) has been applied here to analyze the similarity of all the model results to suggest in advance, the replacement and correction of the deteriorating units and prevent severe system break downs and disruptions.

DE PCA; Condition monitoring; Fault diagnosis; Wind turbine generators
AB The operation process of the wind turbine generator is complex, the running state variables are many, and the variables are related to each other. It is difficult to achieve the expected results if the traditional fault diagnosis method is used. The fault diagnosis method based on principal component analysis (PCA) of the feature extraction of wind turbine generator is presented in this paper. The principal component model is established based on the normal working condition history data at first, and the control limits of Hotelling T-2 and SPE two statistics are obtained. The condition monitoring and fault location of generating sets are realized by comparing the statistics of real-time operation and the size of the threshold. The experimental simulation results of the operation data of the wind turbine generator show the effectiveness of the method.

AB Wind energy has gained a considerable attention from industries and academia to increase the reliability and availability of wind turbines (WTs) and, consequently, to reduce wind energy cost. With this attention has come investments and new technologies from WT manufacturers as industrial solutions. Among these technologies the new arrivals, the variable speed generation systems based on permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) with full-scale power converters are an emerging and promising technology. Better designs of the WT components is of course one answer to the solution of this problem; the other is condition monitoring of the WT systems. This allows to reduce maintenance cost, hardware damaging and unscheduled downtime. In this context, this paper investigates the possibility to detect mechanical faults by analysing the electrical signals with the aim of improving the reliability of WTs based on PMSGs. Rotor eccentricity is used as an illustrative example to describe how the fault signature frequencies may occur in PMSG current signals, and potentially how they may deviate from a healthy state, firstly under steady state, constant speed test operation and secondly under transient, variable speed conditions. Simulation results yield valuable information for condition monitoring and effective algorithm development for fault detection.

AB Wind power has become the world's fastest growing renewable energy source in the past decade. Reducing the operation and maintenance cost is critical for wind power to compete with conventional energy source. This paper provides a thorough review of failure modes of wind turbines followed by discussion on existing condition monitoring and diagnostics techniques and future development needs. Non-invasive techniques with minor hardware modification requirement and high integration potential with the existing system provide the strongest attraction to wind industry.

AB Improved fault diagnostic techniques in wind turbines is a field of growing interest, given the negative impact that unexpected breakdowns have on the profitability of wind farms. Traditional and new diagnostic techniques mainly based, respectively, on vibration and generator current monitoring cannot be applied easily to small wind groups due to the very restrictive cost limitations. This paper proposes a fault diagnosis technique based on monitoring generator voltage, current and power suitable for small wind groups based on permanent magnet synchronous generators which aims to offer an affordable solution that provides easy to understand information even for users lacking technologic training, helping them decide when to ask for specialized assistance. This proposal is based on data provided by a commercial monitoring system installed between the generator and the regenerative inverter and processed and displayed in a mobile device (smartphone or tablet PC) App running either Android or iOS, thus greatly contributing to a very cost-effective solution. The actual performance of an off-the-shelf small wind group has been measured both off-line and on-line (by the diagnosis App during the training stage) with good agreement and confirms the suitability of the method to detect demagnetization faults.

AB Condition monitoring of wind turbine gearbox based on cointegration by vibration signals is investigated in this research. Firstly, we establish cointegration model of gearbox in normal condition and analyze the stability of the residuals calculated by cointegration model. According to the principle of cointegration, once gearbox failure occurs, the cointegration relationship is broken and the stability of residuals changes. Therefore, we set thresholds of residuals as the early failure warning condition. Finally, through the simulation analysis of gearbox fault data, the computational results verify the effectiveness of proposed approach in monitoring condition of wind turbine gearbox.

AB Unscheduled or reactive maintenance on wind turbines due to component failures incurs significant downtime and, in turn, loss of revenue. To this end, it is important to be able to perform maintenance before it's needed. By continuously monitoring turbine health, it is possible to detect incipient faults and schedule maintenance as needed, negating the need for unnecessary periodic checks. To date, a strong effort has been applied to developing Condition monitoring systems (CMSs) which rely on retrofitting expensive vibration or oil analysis sensors to the turbine. Instead, by performing complex analysis of existing data from the turbine's Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, valuable insights into turbine performance can be obtained at a much lower cost.
   In this paper, data is obtained from the SCADA system of a turbine in the South-East of Ireland. Fault and alarm data is filtered and analysed in conjunction with the power curve to identify periods of nominal and fault operation. Classification techniques are then applied to recognise fault and fault-free operation by taking into account other SCADA data such as temperature, pitch and rotor data. This is then extended to allow prediction and diagnosis in advance of specific faults. Results are provided which show success in predicting some types of faults.

ID MACHINES; MODEL
AB Nowadays harnessing electric power wind is one of the most important forms of sustainable power production. A doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) has been commonly used in wind turbines. DFIG has been affected negatively by the short circuit fault of rotor windings, so it is core important to examine doubly-fed induction generator for safe and continuous operation of the wind turbine. For this purpose, an experiment has been setup to detect inter-turn short circuit faults in rotor phase. Experimental setup with a 380 V, 50 Hz, 4-pole 100 kW three-phase wound rotor induction machine has been used to get the real experimental data. Three phase rotor currents are measured to detect the inter-turn short circuit fault. Root mean square (RMS) value of rotor currents, ratio between negative to positive sequence of current and phase difference are used to analyze the faults. The RMS value of the rotor three phase current increases as the fault grows. When the inter-turn short circuit fault occurs the negative sequence of current appears and ratio between negative to positive sequence of current also increases with the fault level. The phase difference of Phi-ca increases as the fault degrees increases and the other two phase difference (Phi-ab and Phi-bc) decreases. The proposed paper is of great importance in the field of the condition monitoring of wind turbine as it is based on the real experimental results.

AB The condition monitoring and diagnosis of insulation system of wind turbine generator (WTG) has become more and more important in recent years. Previous studies have shown that the partial discharge (PD) signals in the inter-turn insulation under induced impulse voltage may probably reflect the information of insulation condition. In this paper, a new type of non-contact current sensor on the basis of electromagnetic induction is designed. The sensor is sensitive to the high frequency low amplitude PD current signal and have flexible and thin framework on consideration of the spacing limitations and convenience of the WTG winding-end measurement. The basic concepts and principles of the sensor design are illustrated, proper materials are selected. The transfer characteristic of the sensor is frequency dependent, so a signal processing program based on Fourier analysis algorithm has been designed to reconstruct the time-domain input current signal from output voltage signal according to certain transfer characteristic of the sensor. Before practical application, the transfer characteristic of the sensor has been studied and tested. In order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the new sensor design, trial sensors have been prepared and put into experiment on a winding model in the laboratory. The artificial defects with the air gaps of 0.2mm thickness and 1mm diameter were attached between any two adjacent turns of an intact WTG stator coil for simulation of inter-turn void defect. 150V similar to 650V impulse test voltage were applied on the inter-turn insulation of the coil with artificial inter-turn air void defect and the PD signals are measured at the same time. The test results indicate that, the newly designed non-contact current sensor has good potential in inter-turn PD detection for WTG.

AB This paper presents an intelligent diagnosis technique for wind turbine imbalance fault identification based on generator current signals. For this aim, Proximal Support Vector (PSVM), which is powerful algorithm for classification problems that needs small training time in solving nonlinear problems and applicable to high dimension applications, is employed. The complete dynamics of a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based wind-turbine (WTG) model are imitated in an amalgamated domain of Simulink, FAST and TurbSim under six distinct conditions, i.e., aerodynamic asymmetry, rotor furl imbalance, tail furl imbalance, blade imbalance, nacelle-yaw imbalance and normal operating scenarios. The simulation results in time domain of the PMSG stator current are decomposed into the Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) using EMD method, which are utilized as input variable in PSVM. The analyzed results proclaim the effectiveness of the proposed approach to identify the healthy condition from imbalance faults in WTG. The presented work renders initial results that are helpful for online condition monitoring and health assessment of WTG. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The fault rate of offshore wind turbines is so high that it is necessary to build a reliable condition monitoring system to improve the maintenance efficiency. To adapt to the harsh operating environment of offshore wind turbine, the condition monitoring system should have good self-healing ability. In this paper, the condition monitoring system of offshore wind turbine is built based on wireless sensor network technology. Focusing on the problem of blind monitoring area caused by sensor nodes failure in the monitoring system, a self-healing strategy is proposed for the monitoring system. By adjusting the sensing distance of the nodes, the blind monitoring area of the system can be repaired by itself. Based on the simulation analysis, it can be found that the blind monitoring area can be repaired in time by the self-healing strategy. At the same time, the total energy consumption and the number of redundant nodes of the system can be reduced significantly.

AB Wind turbines are typically designed for a lifetime of at least 20 years. After almost reaching their targeted lifetime they could be bought at a reasonable price and used by private owners for domestic use. As more turbines reach their design lifetimes the need for the evaluation and assessment on their continued operation is growing. Many older turbines are often not monitored, creating a lack of information on the loads history of a wind turbine. The application of condition monitoring systems for the observation of machines has been state of the art in many industries like the automobile industry, power plant technology, etc. Although components of wind turbines such as the gearbox, generator and main bearings have also been long since monitored, the use of Structural Health Monitoring for the observation on turbine structures however has taken a back seat. Hence, data regarding damage and positions susceptible to fatigue on turbine structures hardly exists. This complicates the effort in assessing the continued operation of a wind turbine. This project intends to determine the remaining useful life and to develop a structural monitoring concept that is economical not only to major stakeholders but also for private owners and small businesses as we transition into sustainable energy.

AB Accurate prognosis of wind turbine generator failures is essential for reducing operation and maintenance costs in wind farms. Existing methods rely on expensive, purpose-built condition monitoring systems to conduct diagnosis and prognosis of wind turbine generator failures. In this paper, we present a prognosis method to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of generators, which requires no additional hardware support beyond widely adopted SCADA system. This work first introduces a notion, Anomaly Operation Index (AOI), to quantitatively measure wind turbine performance degradation in runtime. It then presents a data-driven wind turbine anomaly detection method and a time series analysis method to predict the wind turbine generator RUL. Experimental study on real-world wind farm data demonstrates that the proposed methods can achieve accurate prediction of wind turbine generator RUL and provide sufficient lead time for scheduling maintenance and repair.

ID PREDICTION
AB The maintenance and reliability issues of the wind farms are a matter of high importance both for the offshore and onshore constructions. The technology applied in the wind turbines is fast growing and the wind farms expand rapidly all over the world. European Union countries have set high targets for electricity production through wind till 2020. The maintenance is very important part for a wind farm because we can prevent very important faults even disasters in vital parts of the Wind Turbines (WTs) that may cost hundred thousand euros and lead to long downtimes. Condition monitoring methods are applied in order to prevent high cost damages, save money from maintenance and increase the availability of the system. Moreover, the weather phenomena play a very important role for both the operation and maintenance of the system. For example, in the case of wind or bad weather we cannot have access for maintenance and repair, as a result the downtime increases. The weather parameter is more important in offshore wind farm because the accessibility is more difficult and costly. Using Markov chains we develop a model describing the availability of a wind turbine considering the wind intensity and the operational condition or the downtime of a wind turbine.

AB The total installed capacity of wind turbines is continuously increasing with focus on Renewable Energy Sources (RES). The reliability and efficiency of wind turbines has become a major issue. The occurrence of fault in various components of wind turbine needs to be addressed for improved performance. Among these issues, wind turbine bearing fault is the most significant. Different techniques such as online monitoring using Artificial Intelligence (AI), have been proposed and still research is being carried out in this domain. This paper presents a fault diagnosis analysis of main shaft bearings of wind turbines. The goal is to monitor the condition of wind turbines for early fault prediction so that the turbine can immediately be adjusted for improved performance and extended service life. Different techniques such as Fast Fourier transform (FFT), Hilbert Huang Transformation (HHT), Feature extraction, Logistic Regression (LR) are applied on a real data set of 18 wind turbines to accurately evaluate the health of the turbine. The results highlight the superior and reliable performance of these techniques for bearing fault detection for cost effective operation and maintenance (O&M).

DE power module; reliability; SiC
AB Reliability of power electronic systems is a major concern for application engineers in the automotive and power system sectors. Power electronic modules are one of the main sources of failure in wind energy conversion systems. Power electronic converters used in wind turbine electric drivetrains, railway traction, more-electric-aircrafts, marine propulsion and grid connected systems like FACTS/HVDC require reliable power devices and modules. Wide bandgap semiconductors like SiC have demonstrated enlarged electrothermal Safe-Operating-Areas compared with silicon devices. However, the reliability of SiC power modules and packages has been identified as an area of potential weakness. Traditional packaging systems have been developed for Si hence the different thermo mechanical properties of SiC cause different stresses in the packaging thereby potentially causing reduced reliability. This paper identifies some of the key areas for the development of reliable power electronic systems using SiC. The focus is on condition monitoring, packaging system innovation and thermo-mechanical stress analysis as a function of the mechanical properties of Si and SiC. Power cycling experiments and finite element models have been used to support the analysis.

AB Reliable monitoring for the early fault diagnosis of gearbox faults is of great concern for the wind industry. This paper presents a novel approach for health condition monitoring (CM) and fault diagnosis in wind turbine gearboxes using vibration analysis. This methodology is based on a machine learning algorithm that generates a baseline for the identification of deviations from the normal operation conditions of the turbine and the intrinsic characteristic-scale decomposition (ICD) method for fault type recognition. Outliers picked up during the baseline stage are decomposed by the ICD method to obtain the product components which reveal the fault information. The new methodology proposed for gear and bearing defect identification was validated by laboratory and field trials, comparing well with the methods reviewed in the literature.

AB The maintenance cost of wind turbines has become the significant challenge for the wind power enterprise. One available way to reduce the cost is to monitor the wind turbines and make preventative maintenance. In this paper, an on-line condition monitoring system for wind turbines in plant level was presented. A 4-level monitoring structure was designed for the system, and the network communication was used to transmit the data efficiently. A high performance digital signal processor (DSP) was used as the processing core in the signal acquisition device. A computer software was also developed for data analysis and remote management of the monitoring device. The vibrations, temperature, and some other information of the turbines were gathered synchronously. The monitoring center in wind farm, the data center of wind power enterprise and the remote service center of equipment supplier can know the operation condition of wind turbines well. It would be useful for wind power enterprise to obtain the operation condition of wind turbine and reduce the cost of maintenance.

AB Bearing fault is usually buried by intensive noise because of the low speed and heavy load in direct drive wind turbine (DDWT). Furthermore, varying wind speed and alternating loads make it difficult to quantize bearing fault feature that indicates the degree of deterioration. This paper presents the application of multiscale enveloping spectrogram (MuSEnS) and cepstrum to detect and quantize bearing fault in DDWT. MuSEnS can manifest fault modulation information adaptively based on the capacity of complex wavelet transform, which enables the weak bearing fault in DDWT to be detected. Cepstrum can calculate the average interval of periodic components in frequency domain and is suitable for quantizing bearing fault feature under varying operation conditions due to the logarithm weight on the power spectrum. Through comparing a faulty DDWT with a normal one, the bearing fault feature is evidenced and the quantization index is calculated, which show a good application prospect for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in real DDWT.

ID SYMMETRICAL COMPONENTS
AB Considering the non-stationary operating conditions of wind turbines, electrical signals measured at the stator of their generators will also present variations around their fundamental frequency. This paper presents a method able to efficiently analyse electric quantities measured at the generator stator. The obtained outputs consist in electrical features that fully describe the electrical information contained in the measured three-phase quantities. These features can be directly used or further analysed to obtain efficient fault indicators. The proposed method relies on using the instantaneous symmetrical components to describe the quantities and complex-valued filtering to select the content around the fundamental frequency. The obtained sample per sample algorithm can be implemented on-line, and is able to process stationary or non-stationary quantities in order to extract the useful information around the fundamental frequency. The performance of the proposed method, as well as its capability to detect mechanical faults, is illustrated using experimental data.

AB This paper proposes three algorithms for automatic diagnosis of mechanical system. First of all, an angular resampling with speed measurement correction is introduced. Secondly, a method for the association of detected spectral patterns with the characteristic frequencies of the investigated system is presented. This approach takes into consideration the slippage phenomenon of rolling element bearings. Thirdly, a full-band sideband demodulation method is proposed. It features with multi-rate filtering and offers new health indicators. All methods are applied on the real-world signals of a wind turbine test rig for diagnosis a bearing fault. The comparison of results shows the advantages of the proposed algorithms over well-known health indicators.

   Condition monitoring
AB The number of wind turbines is increasing each year, and with it, the need for methods of condition monitoring and predictive maintenance. During the last years, the number of techniques using 10 min SCADA data has grown and complex and efficient models are now available. Nevertheless, the non-stationary operating condition of wind turbines is still an issue. This paper will present a new approach using the similarity between the turbines behavior for fault detection. Then a more classical approach using data coming from a single turbine will be tested on two different generator failures to compare the results.

AB The key objectives of wind turbine manufactures and buyers are to reduce the Total Cost of Ownership and Total Cost of Energy. Among others, low downtime of a wind turbine is important to increase the amount of energy produced during its lifetime. Historical data indicate that pitch systems accounts for a substantial part of the downtime of wind turbines. With a focus on fluid power pitch systems; this paper presents an overview of methods relevant to assessing and increasing the reliability and availability of such systems. Four major areas are identified and covered; failure analysis, reliability and availability assessment, condition monitoring and fault-tolerant control. Within each area a brief description of the state of the art is given. On basis of the state of the art, a discussion is given on where further work is required in order to obtain a systematic framework for designing reliable fluid power.

   oil sample analysis; wear debris analysis
AB Despite the wind industry's dramatic development during the past decade, it is still challenged by premature turbine subsystem/component failures, especially for turbines rated above 1 MW. Because a crane is needed for each replacement, gearboxes have been a focal point for improvement in reliability and availability. Condition monitoring (CM) is a technique that can help improve these factors, leading to reduced turbine operation and maintenance costs and, subsequently, lower cost of energy for wind power. Although technical benefits of CM for the wind industry are normally recognized, there is a lack of published information on the advantages and limitations of each CM technique confirmed by objective data from full-scale tests. This article presents first-hand oil and wear debris analysis results obtained through tests that were based on full-scale wind turbine gearboxes rated at 750 kW. The tests were conducted at the 2.5-MW dynamometer test facility at the National Wind Technology Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The gearboxes were tested in three conditions: run-in, healthy, and damaged. The investigated CM techniques include real-time oil condition and wear debris monitoring, both inline and online sensors, and offline oil sample and wear debris analysis, both onsite and offsite laboratories. The reported results and observations help increase wind industry awareness of the benefits and limitations of oil and debris analysis technologies and highlight the challenges in these technologies and other tribological fields for the Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers and other organizations to help address, leading to extended gearbox service life.

AB As we know that energy is important part of our life. Energy available in different form like heat energy, solar energy, wind energy, etc. In our day to day life importance of alternative and renewable energy source increases year by year because of limited availability of non-renewable energy source. Hence it is necessary to take preventive action and increase the use of renewable energy source. Renewable energy source includes mainly solar energy, wind energy, vermin-composing, etc. For that purpose we address the issue related to renew-able energy source like windmills. In this paper we present maintenance related to wind farms which consist of number of windmills using wireless technique. We used reasonable and elastic wireless sensors networks can be installed within a large structure to evaluate the response and performing monitoring algorithms. In this paper, wireless sensors are located on a wind mill which is located in wind farm to monitor the structures to present models of wind turbine.

AB Present Wind mills have certain limiting factors. Most of the wind farms are located quiet far from the power utilizing areas; Monitoring and controlling of such farms are very tedious. Wind farms may be located far inside the sea, may be between the mountains, or Forests. Thus when minor faults occur, the people have to go to that particular location for fault clearing. It requires lot of man power, time and faces sever economical difficulties. Readings of a particular plant is also taken by the similar methods. These limitations can be overcome by the use of Internet of Things concept. Most of the existing products use memory card or PC for data logging This stored data is accessible only in that particular PC alone. This limitation is also addressed by IoT technology. This work proposes a low cost Wind turbine monitoring and control system with data logging facility. By the use of this proposed system, Parameters of the particular wind plant like amount of Power generation, Magnitude of instantaneous voltage and currents, level of vibration, Turbine speed, Humidity and Temperature can be monitored and used anywhere. In the proposed system Turbine control is adopted based on the turbine vibration level and IoT is implemented by using Raspberry Pi and arduino microcontrollers.

ID FAILURE MODES
AB This paper discusses a fuzzy cost-based failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA) approach for wind turbines. Conventional FMECA methods use a crisp risk priority number (RPN) as a measure of criticality which suffers from the difficulty of quantifying the risk. One method of increasing wind turbine reliability is to install a condition monitoring system (CMS). The RPN can be reduced with the help of a CMS because faults can be detected at an incipient level, and preventive maintenance can be scheduled. However, the cost of installing a CMS cannot be ignored. The fuzzy cost-based FMECA method proposed in this paper takes into consideration the cost of a CMS and the benefits it brings and provides a method for determining whether it is financially profitable to install a CMS. The analysis is carried out in MATLAB (R) which provides functions for fuzzy logic operation and defuzzification.

AB Vibration analysis of the generator bearing of a large wind turbine using demodulation techniques is discussed in this paper. The purpose of this paper is to show how capable these techniques are for small shaft speed variations. Highest energy band was calculated by wavelet packet transform for amplitude and phase demodulation. Results from the vibration analysis were consistent with a localized outer-race bearing fault. They were then validated by cutting the bearing with water jet machine. A significant localized fault was found on the outer race.

AB The renewable energy industry is undergoing continuous improvement and development worldwide, wind energy being one of the most relevant renewable energies. This industry requires high levels of reliability, availability, maintainability and safety (RAMS) for wind turbines. The blades are critical components in wind turbines. The objective of this research work is focused on the fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) of the wind turbine blades. The FDD approach is composed of a robust condition monitoring system (CMS) and a novel signal processing method. CMS collects and analyses the data from different non-destructive tests based on acoustic emission. The acoustic emission signals are collected applying macro-fiber composite (MFC) sensors to detect and locate cracks on the surface of the blades. Three MFC sensors are set in a section of a wind turbine blade. The acoustic emission signals are generated by breaking a pencil lead in the blade surface. This method is used to simulate the acoustic emission due to a breakdown of the composite fibers. The breakdown generates a set of mechanical waves that are collected by the MFC sensors. A graphical method is employed to obtain a system of non-linear equations that will be used for locating the emission source. This work demonstrates that a fiber breakage in the wind turbine blade can be detected and located by using only three low cost sensors. It allows the detection of potential failures at an early stages, and it can also reduce corrective maintenance tasks and downtimes and increase the RAMS of the wind turbine.

AB Nowadays offshore wind energy is the renewable energy source with the highest growth. Offshore wind farms are composed of large and complex wind turbines, requiring a high level of reliability, availability, maintainability and safety (RAMS). Firms are employing robust remote condition monitoring systems in order to improve RAMS, considering the difficulty to access the wind farm. The main objective of this research work is to optimise the maintenance management of wind farms through the fault probability of each wind turbine. The probability has been calculated by Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) employing the Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) in order to reduce the computational cost. The fault tree presented in this paper has been designed and validated based on qualitative data from the literature and expert from important European collaborative research projects. The basic events of the fault tree have been prioritized employing the criticality method in order to use resources efficiently. Exogenous variables, e.g., weather conditions, have been also considered in this research work. The results provided by the dynamic probability of failure and the importance measures have been employed to develop a scheduled maintenance that contributes to improve the decision making and, consequently, to reduce the maintenance costs.

AB Wind power does not pollute and is recyclable. The speed of the blades of a wind turbine speeds considerably affect the measured output power of the turbine. The speed of the tip of the blade must be set to maximize power output. The speed of the blade also significantly affects energy losses and the power coefficients. The former should be minimized and the latter maximized. Various loads on a turbine during its operation must be considered. The on-line monitoring system is important to predicting the conditions and detecting faults in a wind turbine, as required for its maintenance. This work develops a condition monitoring system and fault detection system for wind turbines. Signal analysis is utilized in the development of a system for diagnosing various failure modes. The on-line monitoring system is proved to be a beneficial investment that reduces the cost of maintaining an offshore wind power plant and its downtime, while increasing overall reliability. However, available monitoring methods cannot diagnose faults in the main equipment of power plants. Liquid penetrant inspections are effective in detecting cracks in the blades of wind turbines.

AB This paper investigates the electrically operated pitch systems of offshore wind turbines for online condition monitoring and health assessment. The current signature based fault diagnostics is developed for electrically operated pitch systems using model-based approach. The electrical motor faults are firstly modelled based on modified winding function theory and then, current signature analysis is performed to detect the faults. Further, in order to verify the fault diagnostics capabilities in realistic conditions, the operating pro files are obtained from FAST simulation of offshore wind turbines in various wind conditions. In this way, the applicability of current signature analysis for fault diagnostics in offshore wind turbine pitch systems is demonstrated.

ID SYSTEM
AB Effective condition monitoring techniques for wind turbines are needed to improve maintenance processes and reduce operational costs. Normal behaviour modelling of temperatures with information from other sensors can help to detect wear processes in drive trains. In a case study, modelling of bearing and generator temperatures is investigated with operational data from the SCADA systems of more than 100 turbines. The focus is here on automated training and testing on a farm level to enable an on-line system, which will detect failures without human interpretation. Modelling based on linear combinations, artificial neural networks, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems, support vector machines and Gaussian process regression is compared. The selection of suitable modelling inputs is discussed with cross-correlation analyses and a sensitivity study, which reveals that the investigated modelling techniques react in different ways to an increased number of inputs. The case study highlights advantages of modelling with linear combinations and artificial neural networks in a feed-forward configuration.

AB The influence of friction on wind turbines (WTs) is often seen as undesirable as it has been proven to be the root cause of different severe damages, where the most vulnerable WT's components are bearings. Accurate modelling and identification of friction affects are thus required in order to characterise frictional behaviour and prevent severe damages. This paper addresses the problem on the real-time estimation of friction levels that vary in time with different rates in the WT's blade bearings. Because of ageing or damage progression in bearings, friction parameters change in time. Knowing the material properties and a damage model, monitoring of the friction can be used for condition monitoring of WT's blade bearings. The considered nonlinear identification methods suitable for estimation of fast varying parameters are the extended Kalman filter (EKF), the unscented Kalman filter, the particle filter (PF) and the PF combined with the EKF. This paper also proposes a novel modification of a differential evolution algorithm for the identification of parameters that slowly vary in time. The main contribution of this paper is the algorithm, which combines the modified differential evolution algorithm with optimal nonlinear filters for the estimation of parameters which vary at different rates. A LuGre friction model and a realistic WT sensor setup are selected. The techniques are benchmarked against simulated WT data, and their performances are compared and discussed.

TI New oil condition monitoring system, Wearsens((R)) enables continuous,
   online detection of critical operating conditions and wear damage
SO JURNAL TRIBOLOGI
LA English
DT Article
DE Oil sensor system; Online condition monitoring; Preventive maintenance
AB A new oil sensor system is presented for the continuous, online measurement of the wear in turbines, industrial gears, generators, hydraulic systems and transformers. Detection of change is much earlier than existing technologies such as particle counting, vibration measurement or recording temperature. Thus targeted, corrective procedures and/or maintenance can be carried out before actual damage occurs. Efficient machine utilization, accurately timed preventive maintenance, increased service life and a reduction of downtime can all be achieved. The presented sensor system effectively controls the proper operation conditions of bearings and cogwheels in gears. The online diagnostics system measures components of the specific complex impedance of oils. For instance, metal abrasion due to wear debris, broken oil molecules, forming acids or oil soaps, result in an increase of the electrical conductivity, which directly correlates with the degree of contamination of the oil. For additivated lubricants, the stage of degradation of the additives can also be derived from changes in the dielectric constant. The determination of impurities or reduction in the quality of the oil and the quasi continuous evaluation of wear and chemical aging follow the holistic approach of a real-time monitoring of an alteration in the condition of the oil-machine system. Once the oil condition monitoring sensors are installed on the wind turbine, industrial gearbox and test stands, the measuring data can be displayed and evaluated elsewhere. The signals are transmitted to a web-based condition monitoring system via LAN, WLAN or serial interfaces of the sensor unit. Monitoring of the damage mechanisms during proper operation below the tolerance limits of the components enables specific preventive maintenance independent of rigid inspection intervals.

AB This paper deals with the condition monitoring of wind turbine gearboxes under varying operating conditions. Generally, gearbox systems include nonlinearities so a simplified nonlinear gear model is developed, on which the time-frequency analysis method proposed is first applied for the easiest understanding of the challenges faced. The effect of varying loads is examined in the simulations and later on in real wind turbine gearbox experimental data. The Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method is used to decompose the vibration signals into meaningful signal components associated with specific frequency bands of the signal. The mode mixing problem of the EMD is examined in the simulation part and the results in that part of the paper suggest that further research might be of interest in condition monitoring terms. For the amplitude-frequency demodulation of the signal components produced, the Hilbert Transform (HT) is used as a standard method. In addition, the Teager-Kaiser energy operator (TKEO), combined with an energy separation algorithm, is a recent alternative method, the performance of which is tested in the paper too. The results show that the WED approach is a promising alternative to the HT, since it can improve the estimation of the instantaneous spectral characteristics of the vibration data under certain conditions.

AB The use of condition monitoring systems on offshore wind turbines has increased dramatically in recent times. However, their use is mostly restricted to vibration based monitoring systems for the gearbox, generator and drive train. A survey of commercially available condition monitoring systems and their associated costs has been completed for the blades, drive train, tower and foundation. This paper considers what value can be obtained from integrating these additional systems into the maintenance plan. This is achieved by running simulations on an operations and maintenance model for a wind farm over a 20 year life cycle. The model uses Hidden Markov Models to represent both the actual system state and the observed condition monitoring state. The CM systems are modelled to include reduced failure types, false alarms, detection rates and 6 month failure warnings. The costs for system failures are derived, as are possible reductions in costs due to early detection. The detection capabilities of the CM systems are investigated and the effects on operational costs are examined. Likewise, the number of failures detected 6 months in advance by the CM systems is modified and the costs reported.

SO WIND ENERGY

ID TIME-SERIES; EQUATIONS; LAYER
AB Based on the Langevin equation, it has been proposed to obtain power curves for wind turbines from high-frequency data of wind speed measurements u(t) and power output P(t). The two parts of the Langevin approach, power curve and drift field, give a comprehensive description of the conversion dynamic over the whole operating range of the wind turbine. The method deals with high- frequent data instead of 10min means. It is therefore possible to gain a reliable power curve already from a small amount of data per wind speed. Furthermore, the method is able to visualize multiple fixed points, which is, e.g. characteristic for the transition from partial to full load or in case the conversion process deviates from the standard procedures. In order to gain a deeper knowledge, it is essential that the method works not only for measured data but also for numerical wind turbine models and synthetic wind fields. Here, we characterize the dynamics of a detailed numerical wind turbine model and calculate the Langevin power curve for different data samplings. We show how to obtain reliable results from synthetic data and verify the applicability of the method for field measurements with ultra-sonic, cup, and Lidar measurements. The independence of the fixed points on site- specific turbulence effects is also confirmed with the numerical model. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of the Langevin approach to detect failures in the conversion process and thus show the potential of the Langevin approach for a condition monitoring system.

AB This paper presents a discussion of the development of wind energy generation in the United Kingdom and the challenges faced by the wind industry including reliability, performance and condition monitoring, particularly in the offshore environment. The worldwide installed capacity of offshore wind has now risen to over 7GW, with an ever increasing deployment rate of new assets. About 90% of the global currently installed capacity is in Northern Europe, with the United Kingdom having the world's largest share at 4GW. Capacity factor data from UK offshore wind farms is presented, providing an insight into the current performance of large Round 2 offshore wind farms compared to the earlier Round 1 farms and to onshore farms. The data reveal that the United Kingdom's Round 2 offshore farms are achieving an average monthly capacity factor of 38.3% with a peak value of 75.8%. The older Round 1 farms have a lower average capacity factor of 33.6% while large onshore farms with capacities above 100 MW have achieved 25.6%. Offshore wind turbine performance has improved over time, and the industry is applying the learning from early experiences to achieve better performances at the more recently installed farms. Despite these improvements in turbine availability, the cost of energy from wind, particularly offshore, remains too high for it to be a commercially viable form of generation without subsidies. Reducing the cost of energy from wind to economically sustainable levels is the most important challenge facing the industry today. Operation and maintenance costs constitute up to 30 % of the total cost of energy from wind in large farms. The industry must overcome the challenges associated with improving component reliability and the development and adoption by operators of appropriate condition monitoring systems and maintenance strategies, in order to reduce costs to sustainable levels. Research and development work carried out with these goals in mind is also reviewed in the paper.

AB Planetary gearboxes (PGBs) are widely used in the drivetrain of wind turbines. Any PGB failure could lead to breakdown of the whole drivetrain and major loss of wind turbines. Therefore, PGB fault diagnosis is important in reducing the downtime and maintenance cost and improving the reliability and lifespan of wind turbines. PGB fault diagnosis has been done mostly through vibration analysis over the past years. Vibration signals theoretically have an amplitude modulation (AM) effect caused by time-variant vibration transfer paths due to the rotation of planet carrier and sun gear, and therefore, their spectral structure is complex. Strain sensor signals, on the other hand, are closely correlated to torsional vibration, which is less sensitive to the AM effect caused by rotating vibration transfer path. Thus, it is potentially easy and effective to diagnose PGB faults via stain sensor signal analysis. In this paper, a new method using a single piezoelectric strain sensor for PGB fault diagnosis is presented. The method is validated on a set of seeded localized faults on all gears, namely, sun gear, planetary gear, and ring gear. The validation results have shown a satisfactory PGB fault diagnostic performance using strain sensor signal analysis.

AB Incipient defects occurring in long wind turbine (WT) blades are difficult to detect using the existing condition monitoring (CM) techniques. To tackle this issue, a new WT blade CM method is studied in this paper with the aid of the concept of transmissibility of frequency response functions. Different from the existing CM techniques that judge the health condition of a blade by interpreting individual CM signals, the proposed method jointly utilizes the CM signals measured by a number of neighboring sensors. This offers the proposed technique a unique capability of both damage detection and location. The proposed technique has been experimentally verified by using the real CM data collected during the fatigue and static tests of a full-scale WT blade. The experiment has shown that the new technique is effective not only in damage detection but also in damage location when either fiber Bragg grating strain gauges or accelerometers are used for data acquisition.

TI Wind Turbine Condition Monitoring Based on an Improved Spline-Kernelled
   Chirplet Transform

DE Chirplet transform (CT); condition monitoring (CM); wind turbine (WT)
ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; POWER; TIME
AB The time-varying operational conditions applied to wind turbines (WTs) not only challenge their operation but also make condition monitoring (CM) difficult. To achieve a reliable CM result, more advanced signal processing techniques, rather than the conventional spectral analyses, are urgently needed for interpreting the nonlinear and nonstationary (NNS) CM signals collected from the turbines. The work presented in this paper is an effort to meet such a requirement. Based on the proven capability of the spline-kernelled chirplet transform(SCT) in detecting the instantaneous frequencies within NNS monocomponent signals, this paper improves the SCT to enable it to detect the instantaneous amplitude of lengthy NNS multicomponent signals at a fault-related frequency of interest. The improved SCT is then applied for developing a new real-time CM technique dedicated to extracting fault-related features from WT CM signals. Experiment proves that the improved SCT has overcome existing SCT issues and is capable of correctly tracking the amplitude characteristics of NNS multicomponent signals at fault-related frequencies of interest. The new CM technique developed, based on this improved SCT, shows success in detecting both mechanical and electrical faults occurring in a WT drive train, despite the constantly varying operational conditions of the turbine. Moreover, its algorithm is efficient in computation, which not only enables it to deal with lengthy NNS CM signals but also makes it ideal for online use.

AB The installation of a condition monitoring system (CMS) aims to reduce the operating costs of the monitored system by applying a predictive maintenance strategy. However, a system-driven configuration of the CMS requires the knowledge of the system kinematics and could induce a lot of false alarms because of predefined thresholds. The purpose of this paper is to propose a complete data-driven method to automatically generate system health indicators without any a priori on the monitored system or the acquired signals. This method is composed of two steps. First, every acquired signal is analyzed: the spectral peaks are detected and then grouped in a more complex structure as harmonic series or modulation sidebands. Then, a time-frequency tracking operation is applied on all available signals: the spectral peaks and the spectral structures are tracked over time and grouped in trajectories, which will be used to generate the system health indicators. The proposed method is tested on real-world signals coming from a wind turbine test rig. The detection of a harmonic series and a modulation sideband reports the birth of a fault on the main bearing inner ring. The evolution of the fault severity is characterized by three automatically generated health indicators and is confirmed by experts.

TI Economic evaluation of maintenance strategies for wind turbines: a
   stochastic analysis
SO IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The authors develop a stochastic model for assessing the life-cycle cost and availability of wind turbines resulting from different maintenance scenarios, with the objective to identify the most cost-effective maintenance strategy. Using field-data-based reliability models, the wind turbine - in terms of reliability - is modelled as a serial connection of the most critical components. Both direct cost for spare parts, labour and access to the turbine, as well as indirect cost from production losses are explicitly taken into account. The model is applied to the case of a Vestas V44-600 kW wind turbine. Results of a reliability-centred maintenance analysis of this wind turbine are used to select the most critical wind turbine components and to identify possible maintenance scenarios. This study reveals that corrective maintenance is the most cost-effective maintenance strategy for the gearbox and the generator of the V44 turbine, while the cost benefit of condition-based maintenance using online condition-monitoring systems increases with higher electricity price, turbine capacity and remoteness of sites.

TI Wind Turbine Blade Life-Time Assessment Model for Preventive Planning of
   Operation and Maintenance
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE maintenance; blades; degradation; fracture mechanics; offshore
AB Out of the total wind turbine failure events, blade damage accounts for a substantial part, with some studies estimating it at around 23%. Current operation and maintenance (O&M) practices typically make use of corrective type maintenance as the basic approach, implying high costs for repair and replacement activities as well as large revenue losses, mainly in the case of offshore wind farms. The recent development and evolution of condition monitoring techniques, as well as the fact that an increasing number of installed turbines are equipped with online monitoring systems, offers a large amount of information on the blades structural health to the decision maker. Further, inspections of the blades are often performed in connection with service. In light of the obtained information, a preventive type of maintenance becomes feasible, with the potential of predicting the blades remaining life to support O&M decisions for avoiding major failure events. The present paper presents a fracture mechanics based model for estimating the remaining life of a wind turbine blade, focusing on the crack propagation in the blades adhesive joints. A generic crack propagation model is built in Matlab based on a Paris law approach. The model is used within a risk-based maintenance decision framework to optimize maintenance planning for the blades lifetime.

TI Micro-Siting of Wind Turbine in Complex Terrain: Simplified Fatigue Life
   Prediction of Main Bearing in Direct Drive Wind Turbines
SO WIND ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION
AB In Japan, 1,516 wind turbine accidents have been recorded between year 2004 and 2012, and 84% of them were for turbines in complex terrains. The longest downtime was associated with damage to main shafts or bearings with an average downtime of 5.7 months. Careful micro-siting in complex terrains can prevent these accidents from happening. The objective of the paper is to provide an intermediate step that allows consultants, developers, and wind farm owners to further evaluate micro-siting of wind turbines in complex terrains, prior to load simulations by manufacturers. The author developed a simplified method to predict fatigue life of a main rear bearing in direct drive wind turbines. The method uses hub-height 10 minutes wind data as an input. The validation with an actual accident showed practically good agreement of 12.0 years of the predicted life against 12.7 years of the actual life. The method was also applied to quantify the effect of a curtailment. The proposed curtailment increased the predicted life to 35.5 years with a relatively small range of wind speed at a direction of only 1 % frequency distribution. With the proposed method, it is possible to layout turbines where fatigue life of a main rear bearing is longer than its design life. The method can also be applied to existing turbines in order to spot turbines that require careful maintenance, and to consider an installation of condition monitoring system on a bearing.

ID FAULT-DETECTION; OPTIMIZATION
AB Wind Turbines require numerous and varied types of maintenance activities throughout their lifespan, the frequency of which increases with years in operation. At present the proportion of maintenance cost to the total cost for wind turbines is significant particularly for offshore wind turbines (OWT) where this ratio is approximate to 35%. If this ratio is to be reduced in-spite of adverse operating conditions, pre-mature component failures and absence of reliability database for wind turbine components, there is a need to design unconventional maintenance scheme preferably by including novel failure prediction methodologies. Several researchers have advocated the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Bayesian Network Theory (BNT) and other statistical methods to predict failure so as to plan efficient maintenance of wind turbines, however novelty and randomness of failures, nature and number of parameters involved in statistical calculations and absence of required amount of fundamental work required for such advanced analysis have continued to maintain the high cost of maintenance. This work builds upon the benefits of condition monitoring to design methods to predict generic failures in wind turbine components and exhibits how such prediction methods can assist in cutting the maintenance cost of wind turbines. This study proposes using a dedicated tool to assist with failure prediction and planning and execution of wind turbine maintenance. The design and development of such an all-inclusive tool will assist in performing administrative works, inventory control, financial calculations and service management apart from failure prediction in wind turbine components. Its database will contain reference to standard management practices, regulatory provisions, staff details and their skillsets, service call register, troubleshooting manuals, installation guide, service history, details of customers and clients etc. that would cater to multiple avenues of wind turbine maintenance. In order to build such a software package, a robust design of its database is crucial. This work lists prerequisites for choosing a physical database and identifies the benefits of relational database software in controlling large amounts of data of various formats that are stored in such physical databases. Such a database would be an invaluable resource for reliability studies, an area of interest for both academic researchers and the industry that are identifying avenues to economise wind turbine operations.

TI AStrion strategy: from acquisition to diagnosis. Application to wind
   turbine monitoring
SO INSIGHT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper proposes an automatic procedure for condition monitoring. It presents a valuable tool for the maintenance of expensive and spread systems, such as wind turbine farms. Thanks to data-driven signal processing algorithms, the proposed solution is fully automatic for the user. The paper briefly describes all the steps of the processing, from preprocessing of the acquired signal to interpretation of the generated results. It starts with an angular resampling method with speed measurement correction. Then comes a data validation step, in both the time/angular and frequency/order domains. After the preprocessing, the spectral components of the analysed signal are identified and classified into several classes, from sine wave to narrowband components. This spectral peak detection and classification allows the harmonic and side-band series to be extracted, which may be part of the signal spectral content. Moreover, the detected spectral patterns are associated with the characteristic frequencies of the investigated system. Based on the detected side-band series, the full-band demodulation is performed. At each step, the diagnosis features are computed and dynamically tracked, signal by signal. Finally, system health indicators are proposed to conclude the condition of the investigated system. All the steps mentioned create a self-sufficient tool for a robust diagnosis of mechanical faults. The paper presents the performance of the proposed method on real-world signals from a wind turbine drivetrain.

ID CURVES
AB A power performance assessment technique is developed for the detection of power production discrepancies in wind turbines. The method employs a widely used nonparametric pattern recognition technique, the kernel methods. The evaluation is based on the trending of an extracted feature from the kernel matrix, called similarity index, which is introduced by the authors for the first time. The operation of the turbine and consequently the computation of the similarity indexes is classified into five power bins offering better resolution and thus more consistent root cause analysis. The accurate and proper detection of power production changes is demonstrated in cases of icing, power derating, operation under noise reduction mode, and incorrect controller input signal. Finally, overviews are illustrated for parks subjected to icing and operating under limited rotational speed. The comparison between multiple adjacent turbines contributes further to the correct evaluation of the park overall performance.

AB As the capacity of wind turbines has increased, the loads on crucial components such as a gearbox, a generator, and blades are significantly increasing. An intelligent online monitoring system is indispensable to protect the excessive load on core components and manage a wind farm efficiently. In order to verify new online monitoring and diagnostic methods for such a monitoring system in advance, a wind turbine simulator is essential. For this purpose, we developed a simulator that has similar dynamics to an actual 3 MW wind turbine, and is thereby able to acquire a state of operation that closely resembles that of the 3 MW wind turbine under a variety of wind conditions.
   This paper describes the implementation of a torque and a collective pitch controller, which is used for a new type of simulator with the intention of exploiting online monitoring and diagnostic methods. The torque and the collective pitch controllers were developed to facilitate variable speed-variable pitch control strategies in the wind turbine simulator. Experiments demonstrated that three control regions were successfully deployed on the simulator, and thereby the simulator was operated at all control regions in a stable and accurate manner. Moreover, the strain and vibration measured from the blade and the gearbox showed different trends at three control regions. Therefore, a new type of simulator is an effective means to develop diagnostic and prognostic algorithms as well as online monitoring methods reflecting the dependency of dynamic characteristics on the control regions.

AB To simplify signal analysis on wind turbine blades and enable their efficient monitoring, this paper presents a novel method of transforming blade moment signals on a horizontal axis 3-blade wind turbine. Instead of processing 3-blade moment signals directly, the proposed algorithm transforms the three sinusoidal signals into two static signals relative to the center of blade rotation through vector synthesis and coordinate transformation, and eliminates frequency components due to blade rotation from the obtained signals. Moreover, as an alternative to a rotational sensor, a blade rotation angle estimator is introduced. Its effectiveness was confirmed through simulations and field tests on an actual wind turbine.

AB Wind turbines are an energy conversion system having a low density on the territory, and therefore needing accurate condition monitoring in the operative phase. Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) control systems have become ubiquitous in wind energy technology and they pose the challenge of extracting from them simple and explanatory information on goodness of operation and performance. In the present work, post processing methods are applied on the SCADA measurements of two onshore wind farms sited in southern Italy. Innovative and meaningful indicators of goodness of performance are formulated. The philosophy is a climax in the granularity of the analysis: first, Malfunctioning Indexes are proposed, which quantify goodness of merely operational behavior of the machine, irrespective of the quality of output. Subsequently the focus is shifted to the analysis of the farms in the productive phase: dependency of farm efficiency on wind direction is investigated through the polar plot, which is revisited in a novel way in order to make it consistent for onshore wind farms. Finally, the inability of the nacelle to optimally follow meandering wind due to wakes is analysed through a Stationarity Index and a Misalignment Index, which are shown to capture the relation between mechanical behavior of the turbine and degradation of the power output.

AB A new diagnostic method is proposed to efficiently monitor the structural health and detect damages in wind turbine blades. A high-resolution real-time blade condition monitoring system that considers the harsh turbine operating environment and uses optical sensors and a wireless network is presented. A hybrid algorithm, which merges probabilistic analysis, design loads, and real-time load estimates, is introduced to enhance operational safety and reliability. Moreover, the alarm limits are updated every 10 min through a learning algorithm to further improve reliability. The proposed algorithm was implemented in a blade monitoring system. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated for a 3-MW wind turbine in the Yeongheung wind farm.

DE E-maintenance; RCM; Wind turbines; Gearboxes; Oil analysis
AB Renewable energy sources such as wind energy are available without any limitations. In order to extract this energy efficiency, the reliability of such technologies is critical if pay back periods and power generation requirements are to be met. Due to recent developments in the field of wind engineering and in particular the expansion of installed capacity around the world, the need for reliable and intelligent diagnostic tools is of greater importance. The number of offshore wind turbines installed in the seas around Britain's coasts is likely to increase from just fewer than 150-7,500 over the next 10 years with the potential cost of 10 pound billion. Operation and Maintenance activities are estimated to be 35 % against the cost of electricity. However, the development of appropriate and efficient maintenance strategies is currently lacking in the wind industry. The current reliability and failure modes of offshore wind turbines are known and have been used to develop preventive and corrective maintenance strategies which have done little to improve reliability. In addition, the failure of one minor component can cause escalated damage to a major component, which can increase repair and or replacement costs. A reliability centered maintenance (RCM) approach offers considerable benefit to the management of wind turbine operations since it includes an appreciation of the impact of faults on operations. Due to the high costs involved in performing maintenance and the even higher costs associated with failures and subsequent downtime and repair, it is critical that the impacts are considered when maintenance is planned. This paper provides an overview of the application of RCM and on line e-condition monitoring to wind turbine maintenance management. Unplanned maintenance levels can be reduced by increasing the reliability of the gear box and individual gears through the analysis of lubricants. Finally the paper will discuss the development of a complete sensor-based processing unit that can continuously monitor the wind turbines lubricated systems and provide, via wireless technology, real time data enabling on shore staff with the ability to predict degradation anticipate problems and take remedial action before damage and failure occurs.

ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS
AB Modern condition monitoring systems (CMS) collect and process enormous amount of data in order to provide the earliest and most dependable information of fault development within any of the machine components and their operation combined. According to numerous studies one of the most fault susceptible mechanical elements in rotating machinery are rolling element bearings. Although reliable techniques for their diagnostics are already proposed, the new investigation is needed. According to authors experience in many industrial applications the operators are obligated to simultaneously track hundreds of diagnostic estimates, such as signals energy, its peakedness or narrowband characteristics for localized faults. As mentioned, for a vibration-based CMS of single wind turbine there are nearly 150 of them. Therefore, the authors employ a fuzzy logic approach for integration of bearing diagnostic features. A new estimate that carry most relevant information about bearing condition is discussed. The reasoning is presented on simulated data that mimics real rotating machine.

ID OIL
AB A relatively recent development for the condition monitoring of oil-wetted machinery has been the in-line full-flow inductive wear debris sensor (hereafter referred to as inductive wear debris sensors). These sensors detect a disturbance to a magnetic field caused by metallic wear debris shed from deteriorating dynamic components that is entrained in the lubricant. Applications for these sensors currently include (but are not limited to) aviation machinery, wind-turbine generators, marine propulsion systems, and locomotives. Inductive wear debris sensors can distinguish between ferromagnetic and nonferromagnetic particles as well as providing size and other related information. One of the primary advantages of this sensor type is that the detectable size range is broad and may be used to track the progress of an incipient failure such as the rolling contact fatigue of a bearing or gear as it occurs. One aspect that has received little attention in the literature is the methodology for determining a suitable limit for a particular application. Limits are a critically important aspect of machinery condition monitoring and need to be established by a robust and reliable method otherwise unnecessary maintenance can occur or an incipient fault may be missed. This paper describes a generic method for determining a physically meaningful debris limit for a deteriorating rolling element bearing when utilizing an inductive wear debris sensor.

AB The widespread deployment of industrial wind projects will require a more proactive maintenance strategy in order to be more cost competitive. This paper describes an ongoing research project on developing online lubrication oil condition monitoring and degradation detection tools using commercially available online sensors. In particular, an investigation on particle contamination of lubrication oil is reported. Methods are presented for online lubrication oil condition monitoring and remaining useful life prediction using viscosity and dielectric constant sensors along with particle filtering technique. Physical models are derived in order to establish the mathematical relationship between lubrication oil degradation and particle contamination level. Laboratory experiments are performed to validate the accuracy of the developed models by comparing viscosity and dielectric constant sensor outputs of different particle concentration levels with those simulated by the lubricant deterioration physical models. A case study on lubrication oil degradation detection and remaining useful life prediction is provided. Discussions on the potential for extrapolating the presented methods to typical wind turbine gearbox oil and the practical implementation of particle filter-based approach for online wind turbine gearbox oil remaining useful life prediction are also included.

AB Gearbox transmission system is the major part of the wind turbine drive train. Due to the manufacturing and assembling errors, lubrication condition, wear and uncertainties in material and geometric properties, the system parameters, including mesh stiffness, transmission error and damping of the meshing gears are always uncertain. For a more reasonable evaluation of dynamic characteristics of the gearbox transmission system, the influence of the uncertain parameters should be taken into consideration. Based on the Chebyshev interval method (CIM), the dynamic responses of a geared transmission system with uncertain parameters are thus investigated in this paper. A torsional vibration model is derived for a geared system, in which some parameters including the mesh stiffness, the transmission error, the mesh damping, the shaft damping, the moment of inertia of the input blades and the torsional stiffness of the driving coupling shaft are considered as uncertain but bounded parameters. Interval dynamic equations of the geared system are solved by use of the CIM in combination with the variable-step Runge-Kutta numerical integration method. The accuracy of the CIM is demonstrated in comparison with the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Variations of the upper and lower bounds of the dynamic mesh force with input speed are obtained. The effects of those uncertain parameters on the frequency response of the dynamic mesh force are discussed in detail. It is shown that small parameter uncertainties might be propagated in the vibration system and lead to relatively large uncertainties of the dynamic response of system. The result is of significance for the design and condition monitoring of wind turbine drive trains. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to increase the reliability and availability of wind turbines, condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are considered crucial means to achieve these goals. In this context, direct drives wind turbines based on permanent-magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) with full-scale power converters are an emerging and promising technology. However, several statistical studies point out that power converters are a significant contributor to the overall failure rate of modern wind turbines. Accordingly, this paper presents a new algorithm for multiple open-circuit faults diagnosis in full-scale back-to-back converters, applied in PMSG drives used for wind turbine systems. The proposed method is based on a Luenberger observer and on an adaptive threshold, which can guarantee a reliable diagnosis independently of the drive operating conditions. Several simulation and experimental results using a PMSG drive with a full-scale converter are presented, showing the diagnostic algorithm effectiveness and robustness against false alarms for both generator-and grid-side converters.

AB Planetary gearboxes exhibit unique challenges in bearing fault detection. This paper presents a hybrid approach for fault diagnosis of planetary bearings using an internal vibration sensor and novel signal processing strategies. An accelerometer is mounted internally on the planet carrier to address the issues of variable transmission path. An effective bearing faults detection algorism is developed by employing several advanced signal processing techniques, including Cepstrum whitening, minimum entropy deconvolution (MED), spectral kurtosis (SK) and envelope analysis. The adverse effect of the electromagnetic interference in the signal due to the use of a slip ring is tackled by optimizing the SK technique for demodulation band selection. The proposed method is assessed by analyzing experimental data from a planetary gearbox test rig with seeded bearing faults.

AB Maintenance and repair of wind turbine structures have become more challenging and at the same time essential as they evolve into larger dimensions or located in places with limited access. Even small structural damages may invoke catastrophic detriment to the integrity of the system. So, cost-effective, predictive, and reliable structural health monitoring (SHM) system has been always desirable for wind turbines. A real-time nondestructive SHM technique based on multisensor data fusion is proposed in this paper. The objective is to critically analyze and evaluate the feasibility of the proposed technique to identify and localize damages in wind turbine blades. The structural properties of the turbine blade before and after damage are investigated through different sets of finiteelement method simulations. Based on the obtained results, it is shown that information from smart sensors, measuring strains, and vibrations data, distributed over the turbine blades can be used to assist in more accurate damage detection and overall understanding of the health condition of blades. Data fusion technique is proposed to combine these two diagnostic tools to improve the detection system that provides a more robust reading with reduced false alarms.

AB The extensive deployment of megawatt-scale wind turbines is bringing more challenges to the safety and stability of electric grid than ever before. This is not only because of the unstable wind over time but the increased risk of power quality pollution by defective wind turbines particularly when the turbines today are still experiencing various reliability issues. To prevent the power quality pollution by defective turbines, a new power quality monitoring technique dedicated for individual wind turbines is developed in this paper, so that the quality of the power generated by an individual turbine can be monitored by the wind turbine condition monitoring system. Through simulated and physical experiments on a specially designed test rig, some encouraging results have been achieved. It has been shown that the proposed technique is not only valid for monitoring the power quality of an individual wind turbine, but helpful in detecting the mechanical and electrical faults occurring in the wind turbines.

AB The paper proposes a methodology for reliable design and maintenance of wind turbine rotor blades using a condition monitoring approach and a damage tolerance index coupling the material and structure. By improving the understanding of material properties that control damage propagation it will be possible to combine damage tolerant structural design, monitoring systems, inspection techniques and modelling to manage the life cycle of the structures. This will allow an efficient operation of the wind turbine in terms of load alleviation, limited maintenance and repair leading to a more effective exploitation of offshore wind.

AB A wind turbine blade's structural dynamic response is simulated and analysed with the goal of characterizing the presence and severity of a shear web disbond. Computer models of a 5 MW offshore utility-scale wind turbine were created to develop effective algorithms for detecting such damage. Through data analysis and with the use of blade measurements, a shear web disbond was quantified according to its length. An aerodynamic sensitivity study was conducted to ensure robustness of the detection algorithms. In all analyses, the blade's flap-wise acceleration and root-pitching moment were the clearest indicators of the presence and severity of a shear web disbond. A combination of blade and non-blade measurements was formulated into a final algorithm for the detection and quantification of the disbond. The probability of detection was 100% for the optimized wind speed ranges in laminar, 30% horizontal shear and 60% horizontal shear conditions.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB The dynamic analysis of wind turbine drive train is presented in this paper. A typical wind turbine drive train consists of a rotor, gearbox and generator. The dynamic modelling of epicyclic gearbox that exists in wind turbine is challenging due to the fact that it has both rotating and orbiting gears. The dynamic equations of motion are obtained based on the rigid multibody modelling with discrete flexibility approach by Lagrange's formulation. The dynamic model accounts for the time varying gear tooth mesh stiffness, linear stiffness of bearings and torsional shaft stiffness. The aerodynamic torque that a wind turbine drive train subjected to, is modelled based on the simplified method for load calculation in wind turbine, Danish Standard DS472. The characteristic load value acting per unit length at the two-thirds length of the blade is used for calculating the total load of the torsional moment. The vibration signals that are obtained from wind turbine drive train are nonlinear and nonstationary in nature. This is due to the fact that the applied torque load on drive train is nonlinear and nonstationary in nature. The coupled dynamic model of 18 degrees of freedom is solved for responses in time and frequency domains for some nonstationary wind load realizations. The dynamic responses of the system, contact forces between gear tooth pairs in time and frequency domains are obtained numerically. The study envisages that this dynamic model of wind turbine drive train is very useful for subsequent studies on condition monitoring.

TI Wind turbine rotor imbalance detection using nacelle and blade

   dynamics; pitch control; structural health monitoring
AB Wind power is the world's fastest growing renewable energy source, but operations and maintenance costs are still a major obstacle toward reliability and widescale adoption of wind power, accounting for a large part of the cost of energy for offshore installations. Structural health monitoring systems have been proposed for implementing condition-based maintenance. The wind energy industry currently uses condition monitoring systems that are mostly adapted from roating machinery in other power generation industries. However, these systems have had limited effectiveness on wind turbines because of their atypical operating conditions, which are characterized by low and variable rotational speed, rapidly varying torque, extremely large rotors and stochastic loading from the wind. Although existing systems primarily take measurements from the nacelle, valuable information can be extracted from the structural dynamic response of the rotor blades to mitigate potentially damaging loading conditions. One such condition is rotor imbalance, which not only reduces the aerodynamic efficiency of the turbine and therefore its power output but can also lead to very large increases in loading on the drivetrain, blades and tower. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's fast software was used to model both mass and aerodynamic imbalance in a 5MW offshore wind turbine. It is shown that a combination of blade and nacelle measurements, most of which can be obtained from standard instrumentation already found on utility-scale wind turbines, can be formulated into an algorithm used to detect and locate imbalance. The method described herein allows for imbalance detection that is potentially more sensitive than existing on-line systems, while taking advantage of sensors that are already in place on many utility-scale wind turbines.

AB Increasing worldwide demand for energy has made wind energy a forerunner as a renewable energy resource. Due to this, and due to the intermittent nature of wind, Wind Turbines (WT) reliability should be considered. Improving the reliability of a WT translates into reduced operation and maintenance cost. This highlights the aim of this paper which is a technical review on WTs critical failures as well as an update on recent progress in fault diagnosis and condition monitoring methods used.

AB A wind farm often consists of a number of wind turbines (WTs) operating simultaneously, which not only challenges the operation of the wind farm but makes the condition monitoring (CM) more costly than ever before if each turbine is equipped with a standard commercially available WT CM system (e.g. SKF's WindCon system). With the continual increase of wind farm size, the operator is under increasing pressure to lower the CM cost so that the energy cost can be accordingly reduced in the end. The research presented in this paper is for meeting such a requirement by developing a new cost-effective CM technique based on detecting the transient period of a single WT generator stator current signal. Instead of collecting multiple numbers of CM signals from WT key components, the new technique relies on the use of only a single electric current signal collected from WT generator stator. Moreover, the new technique directly deals with the time waveform of the signal without using any artificial transforms (e.g. Fourier transform). Therefore, it is potentially able to provide more reliable CM result. Experiments have shown that the proposed technique is valid for detecting both the electrical and mechanical faults emulated on a specially designed WT drive train test rig.

AB Recently, alternative non-invasive methods based on electrical signature analysis have been proposed as an effective, easy and cheap way for electrical and mechanical faults detection in complex electromechanical systems such as wind turbines and traction systems. This paper aims to study the torsional vibration effects of a planetary gearbox which is a vital component of wind turbines on the electrical signatures of a wound rotor induction generator through both numerical simulations and experiments. A lumped model of planetary gearbox which needs minimum number of mechanical parameters is linked to the classical model of wound rotor induction generator in abc reference frame. The numerical simulation results show that some of mechanical characteristic frequencies of the planetary gearbox can be identified in the electromagnetic torque and stator current signatures of wound rotor induction generator. A reduced scale wind turbine simulator based on a 5.5 kW wound rotor induction generator is used for experimental verification of the proposed model at different working conditions.

AB Gearboxes are widely used in the drivetrain of rotating machines, such as helicopters and wind turbines. Tracking gearbox degradation is essential to remaining useful life prediction and maintenance decision. Though many degradation features such as root mean square, FM0, and FM4, have been developed, the effectiveness of these features depends on individual components or specific applications. To deploy autonomous fault diagnosis system, new degradation features are often required because a larger number of features facilitate data fusion and generate more accurate degradation paths. This paper proposes to use the parameters of stable distribution to track the degradation of gearbox systems. Two sets of gearbox run-to-failure data, one from laboratory test, and the other from field wind turbine, are used to examine whether the distribution parameters are capable of serving as degradation features. The results show that stable distribution parameters can potentially monitor the degradation trajectory based on their trending profile.

AB Vibration and temperature analysis are the two dominating condition monitoring techniques applied to fault detection of bearing failures in wind turbine generators. Relative movement between the bearing inner ring and generator axle is one of the most severe failure modes in terms of secondary damages and development. Detection of bearing creep can be achieved reliably based on continuous trending of the amplitude of vibration running speed harmonic and temperature absolute values. In order to decrease the number of condition indicators which need to be assessed, it is proposed to exploit a weighted average descriptor calculated based on the 3 rd up to 6 th harmonic orders. Two cases of different bearing creep severity are presented, showing the consistency of the combined vibration and temperature data utilization. In general, vibration monitoring reveals early signs of abnormality several months prior to any permanent temperature increase, depending on the fault development.

AB Wind turbines are renewable energy conversion devices that are being deployed in greater numbers. However, today's wind turbines are still expensive to operate, and maintain. The reduction of operational and maintenance costs has become a key driver for applying low-cost, condition monitoring and diagnosis systems in wind turbines. Accurate and timely detection, isolation and diagnosis of faults in a wind turbine allow satisfactory accommodation of the faults and, in turn, enhancement of the reliability, availability and productivity of wind turbines. The so called model-based Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) approaches utilize system model to carry out FDD in real-time. However, wind turbine systems are driven by wind as a stochastic aerodynamic input, and essentially exhibit highly nonlinear dynamics. Accurate modeling of such systems to be suitable for use in FDD applications is a rather difficult task. Therefore, this paper presents a data-driven modeling approach based on artificial intelligence (AI) methods which have excellent capability in describing complex and uncertain systems. In particular, two data-driven dynamic models of wind turbine are developed based on Fuzzy Modeling and Identification (FMI) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods. The developed models represent the normal operating performance of the wind turbine over a full range of operating conditions. Consequently, a model-based FDD scheme is developed and implemented based on each of the individual models. Finally, the FDD performance is evaluated and compared through a series of simulations on a well-known large offshore wind turbine benchmark in the presence of wind turbulences, measurement noises, and different realistic fault scenarios in the generator/converter torque actuator.

AB Wind turbine system is a safety-critical system, which has the demand to improve the operating reliability and reducing the cost caused by the shut-down time and component repairing. As a result, condition monitoring and fault diagnosis have received much attention for wind turbine energy systems. Noticing that environmental disturbances are unavoidable, therefore how to improve the robustness of a fault diagnosis scheme against disturbances/noises has been a key issue in fault diagnosis community. In this investigation, a robust fault estimation approach with the aid of eigenstructure assignment and genetic algorithm (GA) optimization is presented so that the estimation error dynamics has a good robustness against disturbances. A simulation study is carried out for a 5MW wind turbine dynamic model, which has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

AB The increasing amount of data produced in many scientific and engineering domains creates as many new challenges for an efficient data analysis, as possibilities for its application. In this paper, we present one of the use-cases of the project VAVID, namely the condition monitoring of sensor information from wind turbines, and how a data gateway can help to increase the usability and security of the proposed system. Starting by briefly introducing the project, the paper presents the problem of handling and processing large amount of sensor data using existing tools in the context of wind turbines. It goes on to describe the innovative approach used in VAVID to meet this challenge, covering the main goals, numerical methods used for analysis, the storage concept, and architectural design. It concludes by offering a rational for the use of a data gateway as the main entry point to the system and how this is being implemented in VAVID.

AB Along with the rapid growth of the wind energy sector, reducing the wind energy costs caused by unplanned downtimes and maintenances has aroused great concern of researchers. Condition monitoring system (CMS) is widely used for detecting anomalies of wind power plants (WPPs) so as to reduce the downtimes and optimize the maintenance plan. However, current solutions to condition monitoring of WPPs focus mostly on detecting a particular anomaly on a single component or a subsystem. Optimizing the maintenance plan of whole wind power plant requires a solution to system level condition monitoring of WPPs.
   This paper gives an approach for system level condition monitoring of WPPs using data driven method, that provides an overall picture of the system statuses. Firstly, cluster analysis is utilized to automatically learn the normal behavior model of WPPs from the observations. Two clustering algorithms are explored to choose a suitable one for modeling the WPPs. The presented anomaly detection algorithm uses the learned model as reference to detect the system anomalies. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated with real world data.

ID SYSTEM
AB Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data has been widely applied to identify abnormal conditions in wind turbine generators (WTG). One approach was to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) to SCADA data, comparing the predicted power output of a WTG and its actual output and using the prediction error as an indicator to detect faults. However, complicated training processes limit its application. This paper presents a normal behavior model (NBM), based on power output-generator speed (P-N) curve, to analyze SCADA data from modern pitch regulated WTGs for detecting anomalies. Through analysis of the operational characteristics of the pitch regulated WTG, it is found that inaccuracies in wind speed measurement, the inertia of the rotor, yaw and pitch misalignments, and air density fluctuation may affect the performance of the power curve monitoring algorithms. This paper shows that under normal conditions the P-N curve based NBM performs better when fitting the SCADA data to WTG output under normal conditions than the power curve. Results demonstrate that it can give alarm to forthcoming faults earlier than the existing condition monitoring system (CMS).

AB There is a large financial incentive to minimise operations and maintenance (O&M) costs for offshore wind power by optimising the maintenance plan. The integration of condition monitoring (CM) and structural health monitoring (SHM) may help realise this. There is limited work on the integration of both CM and SHM for offshore wind power or the use of imperfectly operating monitoring equipment. In order to investigate this, a dynamic Bayesian network and limit state equations are coupled with Monte Carlo simulations to deteriorate components in a wind farm.
   The CM system has a 'deterioration window' allowing for the possible detection of faults up to 6 months in advance. The SHM system model uses a reduction in the probability of failure factor to account for lower modelling uncertainties.
   A case study is produced that shows a reduction in operating costs and also a reduction in risk. The lifetime levelised costs are reduced by approximately 6%.

AB Online condition monitoring is an essential task for wind turbine generators' (WTG) reliability enhancement and availability. It leads to early fault detection which can aid in the avoidance of catastrophic failure and reduce the maintenance cost. A wind turbine (WT) test rig is important for the assessment of new methods before introducing them into a health monitoring and integrity diagnosis system. In this paper, a contribution to the development of low-cost WT test rig to assist the condition monitoring of WT is proposed. Depending on wind speed and load conditions, the WTG can operate continuously in non-stationary conditions to assist in condition monitoring. The response of generated current and terminal voltage has also been analysed under speed and load varying conditions. The effectiveness of the setup was benchmarked with already proven WT test rigs. The developed wind turbine emulator (WTE) can be analysed or reconfigured for condition monitoring of wind energy conversion systems (WECS) without the need for real WTs.

AB Wind turbines (WT) maintenance management is in continuous development to improve the reliability, availability, maintainability and safety (RAMS) of WTs, and to achieve time and cost reductions. The optimisation of the operation reliability involves the supervisory control and data acquisition to guarantee correct levels of RAMS. A fault detection and diagnosis methodology is proposed for large-scale industrialWTs. The method applies the wavelet and Fourier analysis to vibration signals. A number of turbines (up to 3) of the same type will be instrumented in the same wind farm. The data collected from the individual turbines will be fused and analysed together in order to determine the overall reliability of this particular wind farm and wind turbine type. It is expected that data fusion will allow a significant improvement in overall reliability since the value of the information gained from the various condition monitoring systems will be enhanced. Effort will also focus on the successful application of dependable embedded computer systems for the reliable implementation of wind turbine condition monitoring and control technologies.

   Threshold
AB Through the analysis of 50 doubly-fed wind turbine gearboxes, the fundamental vibration feature of wind turbine gearbox and the fluctuation range of vibration value during the normal operation were studied. The method of determining the vibration evaluation threshold by using statistical average and standard deviation was proposed. Statistical analysis was performed with 50 wind turbine gearbox vibration signals. The vibration alarm value and hazard value which were proper for model W2000 wind turbine gearbox were calculated and compared with the values given by the standard VDI 3834. The results show that the vibration threshold given by the standard VDI 3834 is conservative. The vibration threshold calculation method proposed in this paper is more suitable for condition monitoring of wind turbine.

AB Wind turbine power curve contains a large number of operational information, it helps to know the equipment operation state if we can analyze these data in a scientific way, it can also help to improve the wind turbine's reliability. This article focuses on two kinds of SCADA data modeling method: the first is parametric modeling based on logistic function, the second is high precision modeling based on least squares. These two methods were used to establish the wind turbine power curve models and the models can be used for condition monitoring when combine with control charts method. It is proved in the industrial case study that this method can detect abnormal SCADA data of wind turbine efficiently.

AB For economic and environmental reasons, wind turbines are becoming a potential renewable power source that could replace conventional fossil-fuelled plants. In remote areas where the power grid is unavailable, these wind plants may be equipped with self-excited induction generators. Order to maximize their productivity, the generators condition has to be continually monitored. For this purpose, many processing techniques have been interested to the analysis of fluently known signals such that vibration, ultrasound, acoustic emission, temperature, electrical amounts, etc. In this work, we present an innovative approach for monitoring the drive speed of such generator. The proposed technique is based on estimation of the instantaneous frequency related to the signal stemming from a stray flux sensor. Experimental investigations conducted on a laboratory test-rig have shown promising results in terms of speed monitoring by the employ of a low-cost sensor.

AB Vibration-based condition monitoring (CM) of geared utility-scale turbine drivetrains has been used by the wind industry to help improve operation and maintenance (O&M) practices, increase turbine availability, and reduce O&M cost. This study is a new endeavor that integrates the vibration-based CM technique with wind turbine gearbox modeling to investigate various gearbox design options. A team of researchers performed vibration-based CM measurements on a damaged wind turbine gearbox with a classic configuration, (i.e., one planetary stage and two parallel stages). We observed that the acceleration amplitudes around the first-order sidebands of the intermediate stage gear set meshing frequency were much lower than that measured at the high-speed gear set, and similar difference was also observed in a healthy gearbox. One factor for a reduction at the intermediate stage gear set is hypothesized to be the soft sun-spline configuration in the test gearbox. To evaluate this hypothesis, a multibody dynamic model of the healthy test gearbox was first developed and validated. Relative percent difference of the first-order sidebands of the highspeed and intermediate stage gear-meshing frequencies in the soft and the rigid sun spline configurations were compared. The results verified that the soft sun-spline configuration can reduce the sidebands of the intermediate stage gear set and also the locating bearing loads. The study demonstrates that combining vibration-based CM with appropriate modeling can provide insights for evaluating different wind turbine gearbox design options.

AB As wind energy is widely used nowadays, it is more and more important to predict wind turbine downtime and organize maintenance just in time. Two types of data systems have been widely adopted for monitoring wind turbine condition: supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and condition monitoring system (CMS). In this paper, a systematic framework is designed to combine CMS and SCADA data and assess drivetrain degradation. Advanced feature extraction techniques are applied to calculate health indicators. A pattern recognition algorithm is used to model baseline and actual condition, Self-organizing Map (SOM) and minimum quantization error (MQE) method is selected to do the degradation assessment. Eventually, the contribution of each component is calculated to achieve component-level fault localization. The approach is validated on a 2 MW wind turbine, where an incipient fault is detected before the wind turbine shuts down.

AB Operation and maintenance (OM) of offshore wind turbines contributes with a substantial part of the total levelized cost of energy (LCOE). The objective of this paper is to present an application of risk-and reliability-based methods for planning of OM. The theoretical basis is presented and illustrated by an example, namely for planning of inspections and maintenance of wind turbine blades. A life-cycle approach is used where the total expected cost in the remaining lifetime is minimized. This maintenance plan is continuously updated during the lifetime using information from previous inspections and from condition monitoring with time intervals between inspections and maintenance / repair options as the decision parameters.

AB Monitoring of trends and removal of undesired trends from operational/process parameters in wind turbines is important for their condition monitoring. This paper presents the homoscedastic nonlinear cointegration for the solution to this problem. The cointegration approach used leads to stable variances in cointegration residuals. The adapted Breusch-Pagan test procedure is developed to test for the presence of heteroscedasticity in cointegration residuals obtained from the nonlinear cointegration analysis. Examples using three different time series data sets-that is, one with a nonlinear quadratic deterministic trend, another with a nonlinear exponential deterministic trend, and experimental data from a wind turbine drivetrain-are used to illustrate the method and demonstrate possible practical applications. The results show that the proposed approach can be used for effective removal of nonlinear trends form various types of data, allowing for possible condition monitoring applications.

AB This paper outlines the initial framework of a dynamic beam Spectral Element Method (SEM) wind turbine model used for estimation of dynamic loads experienced by the wind turbine rotor and tower during operation. Laboratory experiments to characterize various dynamic forms of dynamic loading on wind turbines has been completed. The development of a Condition Monitoring (CM) system for a wind turbine requires an efficient numerical model. An efficient numerical model can compare output-only data by solving an inverse problem to create an estimate of the dynamic and static loads on the wind turbine rotor and tower. Characterizing adverse operating conditions are of interest because they can produce detrimental large amplitude vibrations. The numerical model being developed uses the Legendre Gauss-Lobatto (GLL) SEM spatial integration, and second order Adamas-Moulton scheme for temporal integration, simulating a Timoshenko beam. The efficiency of the GLL SEM makes it an attractive candidate for CM use if the model is to be used in an iterative error minimization scheme. The intended implementation of this numerical model is to modify the stiffnesses and forces of the model to minimize error between the model and experimental data. For CM applications this can be used to identify adverse conditions. Reducing the computational cost of the numerical model in the iterative scheme could provide drastic decreases in analysis time.

AB The operation and maintenance (O&M) costs associated with wind turbines are comparatively high due to the size and complexity of large wind turbine systems. Remote and harsh field locations such as offshore wind farms can further rise those costs. There is a clear need to instrument wind turbines to monitor their behavior to identify damage and deterioration in an effort to lower O&M costs. Towards this end, this study focuses on the deployment of a low-cost wireless monitoring system on a 3kW wind turbine tower to monitor the behavior of the tower under various operational states. Acceleration data and its spectral representation is used to ascertain the normal (undamaged) behavior of the wind turbine under varying environmental and operational conditions.

AB As wind turbines get larger, operation and maintenance costs can be expected to rise unless reliability is improved. One important strategy for achieving this is through condition monitoring. Condition monitoring is a preventive type of maintenance based on the actual health of the wind turbine under observation. Its use allows an operational strategy to be employed based on information measured and provided by a condition monitoring system. This paper outlines the procedure for least square static calibration of inexpensive Microelectromechanical Systems accelerometers identified and instrumented for detecting and measuring changes in natural frequency (key information useful for condition monitoring) of a 4.5 m long wind turbine blade. The calibration procedure converts the local accelerometer coordinates to the global coordinate system of the blade and eliminates the accelerometer offsets from results. The objective is to enable easier comparison of results obtained from multiple accelerometers positioned arbitrarily along the blade, independent of the accelerometer orientation on the usually curved wind turbine blade surface.

AB Wind turbine condition monitoring and fault warning has important practical value to reduce maintenance costs, improve operational efficiency and reliability. In this paper, the characteristic parameters of SCADA system monitoring, based on the principle of similarity modeling techniques, through reasonable storage matrix construction process, the establishment of the gear box "health model" to cover the gearbox to work space. When the gearbox operation occurs, characterized in health parameters deviate from the model, when the offset distance exceeds the threshold value, the system gives the warning. Finally, the health model was validated, experiments show that the method used in this paper can be found early signs of abnormal gearbox and give warning. The results show that the health model by the similar principle established can identify abnormal state timely and accurately, and warning given before a failure occurs, which makes it easier to advance plans to organize maintenance equipment and personnel, to provide a reference for on-site maintenance.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Doubly-fed induction generator is widely used in wind turbine conversion systems. Several research works are being made to efficiently approve existing condition monitoring and fault detection techniques for these systems. The condition monitoring of these systems becomes more and more important, the main obstacle in this task is the lack of an accurate analytical model to describe a faulty DFIG in the majority of the research tasks. In this paper, we present the monitoring strategy of short-circuit fault between turns of the stator windings and open stator phases in doubly-fed induction generator by fuzzy logic technique. The stator condition monitoring is diagnosed based on the root mean square values of current magnitude in addition to the knowledge expressed in rules and membership function. The proposed strategy is verified using simulations performed via the model of Doubly-fed induction generator built in MatLab (R) SIMULINK. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents an intelligent diagnosis technique for wind turbine imbalance fault identification based on generator current signals. For this aim, Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), which is powerful algorithm for classification problems that needs small training time in solving nonlinear problems and applicable to high dimension applications, is employed. The complete dynamics of a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based wind-turbine (WTG) model are imitated in an amalgamated domain of Simulink, FAST and TurbSim under six distinct conditions, i.e., aerodynamic asymmetry, rotor furl imbalance, tail furl imbalance, blade imbalance, nacelle-yaw imbalance and normal operating scenarios. The simulation results in time domain of the PMSG stator current are decomposed into the Intrinsic Mode Frequency (IMF) using EMD method, which are utilized as input variable in PNN. The analyzed results proclaim the effectiveness of the proposed approach to identify the healthy condition from imbalance faults in WTG. The presented work renders initial results that are helpful for online condition monitoring and health assessment of WTG. 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Wind energy is seen as one of t he most promising solutions to man's ever increasing demands of a clean source of energy. In particular to reduce the cost of energy (COE) generated, there are effo rts to increase the life-time of the wind turbines, to reduce maintenance costs and to ensure high availability.
   Maintenance costs may be lowered and the high availability and low repair co sts ensured through the use of condition monitoring (CM) and structural health monitoring (SHM). SHM allows early detection of damage and allows maintenance planning. Furthermore, it can allow us to avoid unnecessary downtime, hence increasing the availability of the system.
   The present work is based on the use of neutral axis (NA) for SHM of the structure. The NA is tracked by data fusion of measured yaw angle and strain through the use of Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The EKF allows accurate tracking even in the presence of changing ambient conditions. NA is defined as the line or plane in the section of the beam which does not experience any tensile or compressive forces when loaded. The NA is the property of the cross section of the tower and is ind ependent of the applied loads and ambient conditions. Any change in the NA position may be used for detecting and locating the damage. The wind turbine tower has been modelled with FE so ftware ABAQUS and validated on data from load measurements carried out on the 34m high tower of the Nordtank, NTK 500/41 wind turbine.

ID DIAGNOSTICS
AB All commonly used condition monitoring systems (CMS) enable defining alarm thresholds that enhance efficient surveillance and maintenance of dynamic state of machinery. The thresholds are imposed on the measured values such as vibration-based indicators, temperature, pressure, etc. For complex machinery such as wind turbine (WT) the total number of thresholds might be counted in hundreds multiplied by the number of operational states. All the parameters vary not only due to possible machinery malfunctions, but also due to changes in operating conditions and these changes are typically much stronger than the former ones. Very often, such a behavior may lead to hundreds of false alarms. Therefore, authors propose a novel approach based on parameterized description of the threshold violation. For this purpose the novelty and severity factors are introduced. The first parameter refers to the time of violation occurrence while the second one describes the impact of the indicator-increase to the entire machine. Such approach increases reliability of the CMS by providing the operator with the most useful information of the system events. The idea of the procedure is presented on a simulated data similar to those from a wind turbine.

AB A hybrid fiber-optic sensor system which combines fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors and a Michelson interferometer is suggested for condition monitoring uses of large scale wind turbine blades. The system uses single broadband light source to address both sensors, which simplifies the optical setup and enhances the cost-effectiveness of condition monitoring system. An athermal-packaged FBG is used to supply quasi-coherent light for the Michelson interferometer demodulation. For the feasibility test, different profiles of test strain, temperature and vibration have been applied to test structures, and successfully reconstructed with the proposed sensor system.

AB A fiber-optic epoxy cure monitoring technique for efficient wind turbine blade manufacturing and monitoring is presented. To optimize manufacturing cycle, fiber-optic sensors are embedded in composite materials of wind turbine blades. The reflection spectra of the sensors indicate the onset of gelification and the completion of epoxy curing. After manufacturing process, the same sensors are utilized for in-field condition monitoring. Because of residual stresses and strain gradients from the curing process, the embedded sensors may experience distortions in reflection spectra, resulting in measurement errors. We applied a Gaussian curve-fitting algorithm to the distorted spectra, which substantially improved the measurement accuracy.

AB Over the last 16 years, pioneering research work has resulted in significant progress in the area of acoustic emission condition monitoring of wind turbine blades. From laboratory static tests on small blades to laboratory full-scale fatigue tests, then to static field tests on actual wind turbines, we are now in the position to instrument and monitor in real time the structural integrity of rotating blades on operating machines with multichannel acoustic emission systems, via the Internet.
   This chapter provides an overview of the research conducted, the various types of tests carried out, and the milestones in developing the application, and summarizes the recent developments on in-service monitoring of wind turbine blades during operation. Emphasis is given to the difficulties faced, the means these were overcome, the challenges that still need to be dealt with, and propositions for future work and research. Apart from summary results from the initial and subsequent laboratory experiments, characteristic results from recent long-term health monitoring of the blades of an operating machine with acoustic emission are presented. The importance of fusion of acoustic emission data with operational data from the wind turbine (wind speed, torque, RPM, etc.), for the proper assessment of the blade's condition, is also demonstrated.

AB Improvement of condition monitoring (CM) systems for wind turbines (WTs) and reduction of the cost of wind energy are possible if knowledge about the condition of different WT components is available. CM based on the WT drive train shaft torque signal can give a better understanding of the gearbox failure mechanisms as well as provide a method for detecting mass imbalance and aerodynamic asymmetry. The major obstacle preventing the industrial application of CM based on the shaft torque signal is the costly measurement equipment which is impractical for long-term use on operating WTs. This paper suggests a novel approach for low-cost, indirect monitoring of the shaft torque from standard WT measurements. The shaft torque is estimated recursively from measurements of generator torque, high speed shaft and low speed shaft angular speeds using the well-known Kalman filter theory. The performance of the augmented Kalman filter with fading memory (AKFF) is compared with the augmented Kalman filter (AKF) using simulated data of the WT for different load conditions, measurement noise levels and WT fault scenarios. A multiple-model algorithm, based on a set of different Kalman filters, is designed for practical implementation of the shaft torque estimator. Its performance is validated for a scenario where there are frequent changes of operating points. The proposed cost-effective shaft torque estimator overcomes all major problems, which prevent the industrial application of CM systems based on shaft torque measurements. Future work will be focused on validating the method using experimental data and developing suitable signal processing algorithms for fault detection. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DE Transmissibility analysis; Wind turbine blade; Condition monitoring;
   Frequency methods
AB Wind turbine blade has a high failure rate as it has to constantly work under varying loads and occasionally suffer extreme weather like storm and sleet. Online condition monitoring plays an important role in finding early or minor damage to avoid catastrophic failure. Due to the large size of blade, condition monitoring systems often use multi-sensors to obtain the blade conditions in different locations. To deal with the multi-sensor data, most conventional frequency methods deal with the multiple sensor data separately without consideration of their correlations. Further, they have to use multiple indicators to represent conditions of different locations. Third, most of frequency methods are dependent on the dynamic loadings and therefore different frequency features and thresholds have to be determined under different loading conditions. To address these problems, this paper employs transmissibility analysis for multi-sensor based wind turbine blade condition monitoring. Transmissibility analysis considers the relations between different senors in the frequency domain, and only produces one single transmissibility damage indicator to represent the condition of the whole wind turbine blade. This is independent of loading conditions and computationally efficient as the main computations only involve Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The effectiveness of the transmissibility analysis is demonstrated using both simulation example and experimental data analysis.

DE acoustic emission; condition monitoring; WTS; NDT
AB Acoustic emission (AE) method of nondestructive check is based on exertion wave radiation and their registration during fast local material structure reorganization. It is used as a means of analysis of materials, constructions, productions control and diagnosis during operating time. In the article, it is applied to structural health monitoring of Wind Turbine Shaft (WTS). Acoustic emission testing has been used for years to test metallic structures. More recently it has become the primary method of testing WTS. However in large structures, the high acoustic attenuation in WTS precludes amplitude analysis unless the origin of the individual signals can be identified and corrections for the distances traveled applied to the signal amplitudes. The usual method of testing WTS structures has been applied an array of sensors spaced so that a moderate amplitude AE signal will just barely trigger each sensor occurring midway between them.

AB Offshore wind turbine requires more systematized operation and maintenance strategies to ensure systems are harmless, profitable and cost-effective. Condition monitoring and fault diagnostic systems ominously plays an important role in offshore wind turbine in order to cut down maintenance and operational costs. Condition monitoring techniques which describing complex faults and failure mode types and their generated traceable signs to provide cost-effective condition monitoring and predictive maintenance and their diagnostic schemes. Continuously monitor the condition of critical parts are the most efficient way to improve reliability of wind turbine. Implementation of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) strategy provides right time maintenance decisions and Predictive Health Monitoring (PHM) data to overcome breakdown and machine downtime. Fault detection and CBM implementation is challenging for off shore wind farm due to the complexity of remote sensing, components health and predictive assessment, data collection, data analysis, data handling, state recognition, and advisory decision. The rapid expansion of wind farms, advanced technological development and harsh installation sites needs a successful CM approach. This paper aims to review brief status of recent development of CM techniques and focusing with major faults takes place in gear box and bearing, rotor and blade, pitch, yaw and tower system and generator and control system.

AB Wind energy is an emerging, clean and renewable source of energy. It is estimated that by year 2035, wind energy will be generating more than 25% of the world's electricity according to International Energy Agency (IEA). With the increase in demand for wind energy, its maintenance issues are becoming more prominent. The scheduled maintenance is more economical than unscheduled repair resulting from failure. So a continuous condition monitoring of various critical components like bearings, gearbox, and shafts of wind turbine is essential in order to enable predictive maintenance. 10% of the total failure is contributed by the bearings, shaft and gear box failures, but the downtime is more than 50% of the total downtime. This paper discusses the development of a bench-top test rig which is designed to mimic the operating condition of an actual wind turbine and use it for monitoring its condition so as to diagnose the incipient faults in its critical components using latest machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Wind energy, being the fastest growing renewable energy source in the present world, requires a large number of wind turbines to transform wind energy into electricity. One factor driving the cost of this energy is the reliable operation of these turbines. Therefore, it is a growing requirement within the wind farm community, to monitor the operation of the wind turbines on a continuous basis so that a possible fault can be detected ahead of time. As the wind turbine operates in an environment of constantly changing wind speed, it is a challenging task to design a fault detection technique which can accommodate the stochastic operational behavior of the turbines. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault detection criterion which is robust against operational uncertainty, as well as having the ability to quantify severity level specifically of the drivetrain abnormality within an operating wind turbine. A benchmark model of wind turbine has been utilized to simulate drivetrain fault condition and effectiveness of the proposed technique has been tested accordingly. From the simulation result it can be concluded that the proposed criterion exhibits consistent performance for drivetrain faults for varying wind speed and has linear relationship with the fault severity level.

AB As the wind power system moves toward more efficient operation, one of the main challenges for managers is to determine a cost effective maintenance strategy. Most maintenance optimization studies for wind power generation systems deal with wind turbine components separately. However, there are economic dependencies among wind turbines and their components. In addition, most current researches assume that the components in a wind turbine only have two states, while condition monitoring techniques can often provide more detailed health information of components. This study aims to construct an optimal condition based maintenance model for a multi-state wind farm under the condition that individual components or subsystems can be monitored in periodic inspection. The results are demonstrated using a numerical example.

AB Nowadays, there is a growing interest in the development of offshore wind farms due to the increasing size and capacity of wind turbines, improvement of wind resources, social acceptance, noise reduction, depletion of onshore locations with great wind resources, etc. However, the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs are too high to make offshore wind turbines economically viable. The use of condition monitoring systems (CMS) appears as a solution to minimize O&M costs and increase the reliability of offshore wind farms. The quantification of the economic benefits of CMS is a non-trivial problem. In this work is presented a novel maintenance management research based of an economic study of the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of CMS for offshore wind turbines. The model includes the costs of investment and O&M of the CMS and costs for reduction of O&M and energy losses of the wind turbine generates by the implementation of CMS. These costs are related with a reliability analysis of a real case study. The application of the economic model on a real case study assuming different scenarios enables the analysis of the economic benefits to use CMS in offshore wind turbines.

ID MODEL
AB The structure of the wind turbines nowadays is a critical element due to their importance from the reliability, availability, safety, and cost points of view. This is more relevant when the offshore wind turbine is considered. This paper introduces a novel design of a Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) model based on ultrasound technique. The FDD model will be able to detect fault/failures via the pulseecho technique. The pulse-echo is got via piezoelectric transducers that are also employed as sensors. The signal processing is based on two steps. Firstly, a wavelet transform is applied to the measured signals with filtering purposes, in order to enhance the signal to noise ratio. Secondly, a time series modeling approach, as an autoregressive with exogenous input model, is employed for pattern recognition by minimizing the Akaike information criterion. An experimental platform is proposed to test the procedure, where pulse-echo experiments were employed before and after a fault occurred. The results from this paper lead to the identification of an early indication of structural problems induced by internal (material, shape, age, etc.) and external (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.) factors. The model can anticipate catastrophic faults, reducing the preventive/corrective tasks and costs, etc, and increasing the availability of the wind turbine, and therefore the energy production.

TI Copula-based model for wind turbine power curve outlier rejection
SO WIND ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
DE wind turbine; power curve; outlier rejection; SCADA; copula model
AB Power curve measurements provide a conventional and effective means of assessing the performance of a wind turbine, both commercially and technically. Increasingly high wind penetration in power systems and offshore accessibility issues make it even more important to monitor the condition and performance of wind turbines based on timely and accurate wind speed and power measurements. Power curve data from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system records, however, often contain significant measurement deviations, which are commonly produced as a consequence of wind turbine operational transitions rather than stemming from physical degradation of the plant. Using such raw data for wind turbine condition monitoring purposes is thus likely to lead to high false alarm rates, which would make the actual fault detection unreliable and would potentially add unnecessarily to the costs of maintenance. To this end, this paper proposes a probabilistic method for excluding outliers, developed around a copula-based joint probability model. This approach has the capability of capturing the complex non-linear multivariate relationship between parameters, based on their univariate marginal distributions; through the use of a copula, data points that deviate significantly from the consolidated power curve can then be removed depending on this derived joint probability distribution. After filtering the data in this manner, it is shown how the resulting power curves are better defined and less subject to uncertainty, whilst broadly retaining the dominant statistical characteristics. These improved power curves make subsequent condition monitoring more effective in the reliable detection of faults. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID DIAGNOSIS; MOTORS; FAULTS
AB This study presents a new technique for detecting rotor electrical faults in wind turbine doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs), controlled by a stator field-oriented vector control scheme. This is a novel method aimed at detecting and identifying rotor electrical asymmetry faults from within the rotor-side inverter control loop, using the error signal, to provide a future method of generator condition monitoring with enhanced detection sensitivity. Simulation and experimental measurements of the proposed signals were carried out under steady-state operation for both healthy and faulty generator conditions. Stator current and power were also investigated for rotor electrical asymmetry detection and comparison made with rotor-side inverter control signals. An investigation was then performed to define the sensitivity of the proposed monitoring signals to fault severity changes and a comparison made with previous current, power and vibration signal methods. The results confirm that a simple spectrum analysis of the proposed control loop signals gives effective and sensitive DFIG rotor electrical asymmetry detection.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB This paper proposes a data driven model-based condition monitoring scheme that is applied to wind turbines. The scheme is based upon a non-linear data-based modelling approach in which the model parameters vary as functions of the system variables. The model structure and parameters are identified directly from the input and output data of the process. The proposed method is demonstrated with data obtained from a simulation of a grid-connected wind turbine where it is used to detect grid and power electronic faults. The method is evaluated further with SCADA data obtained from an operational wind farm where it is employed to identify gearbox and generator faults. In contrast to artificial intelligence methods, such as artificial neural network-based models, the method employed in this paper provides a parametrically efficient representation of non-linear processes. Consequently, it is relatively straightforward to implement the proposed model-based method on-line using a field-programmable gate array. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Blades are among the key components of wind turbines. Blade damage is one of the most common types of structural defects and can cause catastrophic structural failure. Therefore, it is highly desirable to detect and diagnose blade damage as early as possible. In this paper, we propose a method for blade damage detection and diagnosis. This method incorporates finite element method (FEM) for dynamics analysis (modal analysis and response analysis) and the mode shape difference curvature (MSDC) information for damage detection/diagnosis. Finite element models of wind turbine blades have been built and modified via frequency comparison with experimental data and the formula for the model updating technique. Our numerical simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed technique can detect the spatial locations of damages for wind turbine blades. Changes in natural frequencies and modes for smaller size blades with damage are found to occur at lower frequencies and lower modes than in the larger sized blade case. The relationship between modal parameters and damage information (location, size) is very complicated especially for larger size blades. Moreover, structure and dynamic characters for larger size blades are different from those for smaller sized blades. Therefore, dynamic response analysis for a larger sized wind turbine blade with a multi-layer composite material based on aerodynamic loads' (including lift forces and drag forces) calculation has been carried out and improved the efficiency and precision to damage detection by combining (MSDC) information. This method provides a low cost and efficient non-destructive tool for wind turbine blade condition monitoring. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Within this paper a new approach for early damage detection in rotor blades of wind energy converters is presented, which is shown to have a more sensitive reaction to damage than eigenfrequency-based methods. The new approach is based on the extension of Gasch's proportionality method, according to which maximum oscillation velocity and maximum stress are proportional by a factor, which describes the dynamic behavior of the structure. A change in the proportionality factor can be used as damage indicator. In addition, a novel deflection sensor was developed, which was specifically designed for use in wind turbine rotor blades. This deflection sensor was used during the experimental tests conducted for the measurement of the blade deflection. The method was applied on numerical models for different damage cases and damage extents. Additionally, the method and the sensing concept were applied on a real 50.8 m blade during a fatigue test in the edgewise direction. During the test, a damage of 1.5 m length was induced on the upper trailing edge bondline. Both the initial damage and the increase of its length were successfully detected by the decrease of the proportionality factor. This decrease coincided significantly with the decrease of the factor calculated from the numerical analyses.

TI Development of a baseline as a novel strategy for a condition monitoring
   system for the assessment of wind turbine generators
SO INSIGHT
LA English
DT Article
AB Existing wind turbine condition monitoring methodologies can be time-consuming and costly processes that fail to achieve the reliability and operational efficiency required by the industry[1]. Present studies on monitoring data for wind turbines is restricted to a few case histories and for certain sensors is yet scarcer[2]. In order to overcome this issue, the development of a reliable baseline is desirable. In this paper, motor current signature analysis (MCSA) is proposed in order to generate a baseline to define the normal operating conditions of the induction generator in a wind turbine. Electrical current data is collected for an initial period of time, serving as a training process. Different signal processing methods are used to extract the wind turbine generator's features. The features extracted during this initial period are used to create a baseline that defines the behaviour of the generator under normal operation. A range of maximum and minimum values for these features is calculated using statistical methods. Using this approach, the generator monitoring process can be performed by comparing each new set of data acquired to the original baseline created during the initial stage.

   defect detection; failure; pitting
AB The wind energy industry continuously demands significant improvements in wind turbine maintenance strategies through the use of condition monitoring systems (CMS). Regardless of their design, wind turbines have rotating parts that need to be monitored during operation in order to avoid unpredicted failures. In this paper, an experiment conducted at the University of Newcastle is described and initial data analysis is presented. The experiment was performed in a gear test-rig of the Design Unit department, where gearbox contact fatigue tests are frequently performed. The testing procedure involves running of the gears to destruction; starting with 'fresh' gears and operating for a period of time until they fail. In this experiment, the gear being monitored is periodically checked to give an indication of the tooth's cross-section loss. A combination of vibration analysis and acoustic emission (AE) analysis is utilised in this experiment as it is believed that, for reliable diagnosis of rotating machinery, multi-sensing technology should be used. Accelerometers and acoustic emission sensors were deployed throughout the tests, which were conducted in five stages over seven weeks. For the vibration data processing and calculation of the data, the root mean square (RMS) and crest factor values are calculated and frequency spectrum analysis is performed. For the acoustic emission data processing, RMS and energy parameters are calculated. These parameters are shown giving information about the potential gear deterioration over time. Finally, the results of the experiment are presented and show minimal changes in the vibration and acoustic emission parameters in the first two stages of the tests, indicating a reliable baseline reading. However, in the later stages of the tests, data showed a very clear indication of possible gear deterioration, with an increase in the values of RMS for both acoustic emission and vibration data and a modal shift in the vibration spectrum. Visual inspection performed afterwards confirmed the onset of severe macro-pitting failures in the gears.

TI Method for computing efficient electrical indicators for offshore wind
   turbine monitoring
SO INSIGHT
LA English
DT Article
AB The availability of offshore wind turbines is an important issue if such wind farms are to be considered a reliable source of renewable energy for the future. Environmental conditions and the low accessibility of such wind farms have contributed to a decrease in the availability of these wind turbines, compared to onshore ones. In order to improve reliability, condition monitoring systems and the implementation of scheduled maintenance strategies are a must for offshore power plants.
   This paper proposes a method for computing efficient electrical indicators using the available three-phase electrical quantities. These indicators are then to be used to obtain fault indicators for fault detection and diagnosis. The electrical indicators are obtained by using instantaneous symmetrical component decomposition, a well-proven method in the design and diagnosis of power networks. The new quantities are able to fully describe the whole electrical system and provide an effective means to quantify the balance and unbalance in the system. The method uses the electrical three-phase quantities measured at the output of the generator in a wind turbine to obtain the indicators. The performance of this method is illustrated using both synthetic and experimental data.

AB In this paper, a prognostic method is presented for fault detection in gears and bearings in wind turbine drivetrains. This method is based on angular velocity measurements from the gearbox input shaft and the output to the generator, using two additional angular velocity sensors on the intermediate shafts inside the gearbox. An angular velocity error function is defined and compared in the faulty and fault-free conditions in frequency domain. Faults can be detected from the change in the energy level of the frequency spectrum of an error function. The method is demonstrated by detecting bearing faults in three locations: the high-speed shaft stage, the planetary stage and the intermediate-speed shaft stage. Simulations of the faulty and fault-free cases are performed on a gearbox model implemented in multibody dynamic simulation software. The global loads on the gearbox are obtained from a dynamometer test bench and applied to the numerical gearbox model. The method is exemplified using a 750 kW wind turbine gearbox. The case study results show that defects in the high- and intermediate-speed bearings can be detected using this method. It is shown that this procedure is relatively simple, yet accurate enough for early fault detection in wind turbine gearboxes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Condition monitoring helps reduce the operations and maintenance costs by providing information about the physical condition of wind power systems. This study proposes to use a statistical method for effective condition monitoring. The turbine operation is significantly affected by external weather conditions. We model the wind turbine response as a function of weather variables, using a nonparametric regression method named least squares support vector regression. In practice, online condition monitoring of wind power systems often relies on datasets contaminated with outliers. This study proposes to use a weighted version of least squares support vector regression that provides a formal procedure for removing the outlier effects. We determine the decision boundaries to distinguish faulty conditions from normal conditions by examining the variations in the operational responses that are significantly affected by external weather. The results show that the proposed method effectively detects anomalies.

AB Condition monitoring of bearings used in Wind Turbines (WT) is an important issue. In general, bearings diagnostics is a well recognized field of research; however, it is not the case for machines operating under non-stationary load. In the case of varying load/speed, vibration signal generated by rolling element bearings is affected by operation factors, and makes the diagnosis relatively difficult. These difficulties come from the variation of vibration-based diagnostic features caused mostly by load/speed variation (operation factors), low energy of sought-after features, and low signal-to-noise levels. Analysis of the signal from the main bearing is even more difficult due to a very low rotational speed of the main shaft. In the paper, a novel diagnostic approach is proposed for bearings used in wind turbines. As an input data we use parameters obtained from commercial diagnostic system (peak-to-peak and root mean square (RMS) of vibration acceleration, and generator power that is related to the operating conditions). The received data cover the period of several months.
   The method presented in the paper was triggered by two case studies, which will be presented here: first when the bearing has been replaced due to its failure and the new one has been installed, second when bearing in good condition has significantly changed its condition. Due to serious variability of the mentioned data, a decision making process on the condition of bearings is difficult. Application of classical statistical pattern recognition techniques for "bad condition" and "good condition" data is not sufficient because the probability distribution/density functions (pdf) of features overlap each other (for example probability distribution/density function of peak-to-peak feature for bad and good conditions). It was found that these data are strongly dependent on operating condition (generator power) variation, and there is a need to remove such dependency by suitable data presentation. To achieve it, load susceptibility characteristics (LSCh) presenting as feature - operating condition space has been used. Presented approach is based on an idea proposed earlier for planetary gearboxes, i.e. to analyse data for bad/good conditions in two dimensional space, feature - load/rotation speed. Here it has been proven experimentally for the first time that there are two types of susceptibility characteristics related to the type of a fault.
   The novelty of the paper also comes from an extension of previous study that is statistical processing of data (linear regression analysis) in moving window in the long time of a turbine operation is used for feature extraction. It is proposed here to use novel features for long term monitoring. It will be shown that parameters of regression analysis can be used as unvarying, and fault sensitive features for decision making.

AB The benefit of wind turbine (WT) can be significantly improved through a well-organized condition-based maintenance strategy. However, such a target has not been fully achieved today. One of the major reasons is lack of an efficient WT condition monitoring system (CMS). The existing WT CMSs often involve high initial capital cost, with complex structure, suffer from inefficient management and show unsatisfactory hardware reliability. So, the operators still have desire for an economical, effective, and reliable CMS for their machines. The work reported in this paper is intended to meet such a demand. Because direct drive permanent magnet (PM) WTs are showing increased market share, but the existing WT CMSs are not designed to deal specifically with this new design, this paper reports on a CM technique dedicated to monitoring the drive train of direct drive WTs. Instead of taking the vibration analysis approach that is being popularly adopted by commercial WT CMSs, a novel CM strategy is researched in this paper by introducing generator electrical signals into WT CM and interpreting them by using a dedicated criterion named instantaneous variance (IV) and Teager-Huang transform (THT), i.e. the generator electrical signals will be evaluated first by using the IV, of which the fault detection capability can be further enhanced with the aid of empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Once an abnormality is detected, then detailed THT analysis of the signal will be conducted for further investigation. The technique has been verified experimentally on a specifically designed WT drive train test rig, on which a PM generator rotates at slow variable speed and is subjected to varying load like a real WT does. Considering the electric subassemblies and rotor blades of direct drive WTs are most vulnerable to damage in practice, rotor unbalance and generator winding faults were emulated on the test rig. Experimental results show that the proposed CM technique is effective in detecting both types of faults occurring in the drive train of direct drive PM WTs. In summary, the proposed CM technique can be identified by (i) the CM is accomplished through analyzing the generator electrical signals without resorting to any other information (e. g. vibro-acoustic). Hence, the data acquisition work will be eased off; (ii) no more transducer other than current and voltage sensors are required. Thus, the cost of the CMS will be significantly reduced; (iii) attributed to the distinguished superiorities of THT to traditional spectral analyses in processing nonlinear signals, the proposed technique is more reliable in interpreting WT CM signals; and (iv) the CM criterion IV has a simple computational algorithm. It is therefore suited to both online and offline WT CM applications.

AB Wind turbine operational costs can be reduced by monitoring the condition of major components in the drivetrain. SCADA-based condition monitoring is attractive because the data are already collected, resulting in rapid deployment and modest set-up cost. Three SCADA-based monitoring methods were reviewed: signal trending; self-organising maps and physical model. The physical model was identified as being the most reliable at predicting impending component failures. A validation study on this method using five operational wind farms showed that it is possible to achieve a high detection rate and good detection accuracy. An advance detection period of between 1 month and 2 years was achieved by the method. The study has also highlighted limitations and areas for further development.

AB The ability to detect and diagnose incipient gear and bearing degradation can offer substantial improvements in reliability and availability of the wind turbine asset. Considering the motivation for improved reliability of the wind turbine drive train, numerous research efforts have been conducted using a vast array of vibration-based algorithms. Despite these efforts, the techniques are often evaluated on smaller-scale test-beds, and existing studies do not provide a detailed comparison between the various vibration-based condition monitoring algorithms. This study evaluates a multitude of methods, including frequency domain and cepstrum analysis, time synchronous averaging narrowband and residual methods, bearing envelope analysis and spectral kurtosis-based methods. A full-scale baseline wind turbine drive train and a drive train with several gear and bearing failures are tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) dynamometer test cell during the NREL Gear Reliability Collaborative Round Robin study. A tabular set of results is presented to highlight the ability of each algorithm to accurately detect the bearing and gear wheel component health. The results highlight that the cepstrum and the narrowband phase modulation signal were effective methods for diagnosing gear tooth problems, whereas bearing envelope analysis could confidently detect most of the bearing-related failures.

AB This paper presents effective and accurate approaches in vibration-based wind turbine drivetrain component condition monitoring. Detailed spectral analysis and acceleration enveloping techniques were used to effectively extract the gear and bearing damage features. Synchronous analysis was used to accurately detect specific damage features during constantly varying operational conditions. A typical wind turbine gearbox amplifies shaft speed two orders of magnitude from the rotor to the generator. To account for all necessary vibration signatures, synchronous sampling must be carried out for multiple revolutions and at a relatively high rate. The synchronous sampling used in this paper was carried out in the digital domain after both the keyphasor and the vibration signals were digitized at high sampling rate and high sampling resolution analog-to-digital conversion. Sometimes, the shaft speed is provided in a speed time history format, as in the case of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Round Robin project. To carry out synchronous sampling using the speed time history, a unique synthesized synchronous sampling technique was adopted. The approach presented in this paper was realized using MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) codes and then validated with a wind turbine field case. It was also applied to the NREL wind turbine drivetrain condition monitoring Round Robin project. The identified damage results using the techniques discussed were compared with post-test inspection results with good correlation. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Impact Technologies' participation in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Wind Turbine Gearbox Condition Monitoring Round Robin focused on applying multiple vibration diagnostic algorithms to the provided data set. These approaches have been developed and matured by the team in Department of Defense applications for more than 10 years. Generally, the methods employed by the team worked well, once the challenges and peculiarities of the data set were realized. The results of these automated algorithms were also corroborated with visual spectral analysis. Both the blind results, obtained without knowing details on actual gearbox condition, and the conclusions that were drawn after learning the actual damage are each discussed. The algorithms and results are summarized herein. Finally some conclusions and recommendations are provided that may help guide future tests and analysis efforts.

TI Side-band algorithm for automatic wind turbine gearbox fault detection

SO IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION

AB Improving the availability of wind turbines is critical for minimising the cost of wind energy, especially offshore. The development of reliable and cost-effective gearbox condition monitoring systems (CMSs) is of concern to the wind industry, because the gearbox downtime has a significant effect on the wind turbine availabilities. Timely detection and diagnosis of developing gear defects is essential for minimising an unplanned downtime. One of the main limitations of most current CMSs is the time consuming and costly manual handling of large amounts of monitoring data, therefore automated algorithms would be welcome. This study presents a fault detection algorithm for incorporation into a commercial CMS for automatic gear fault detection and diagnosis. Based on the experimental evidence from the Durham Condition Monitoring Test Rig, a gear condition indicator was proposed to evaluate the gear damage during non-stationary load and speed operating conditions. The performance of the proposed technique was then successfully tested on signals from a full-size wind turbine gearbox that had sustained gear damage, and had been studied in a National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) programme. The results show that the proposed technique proves efficient and reliable for detecting gear damage. Once implemented into the wind turbine CMSs, this algorithm can automate the data interpretation, thus reducing the quantity of the information that the wind turbine operators must handle.

AB Deployment of larger scale wind turbine systems, particularly offshore, requires more organized operation and maintenance strategies to ensure systems are safe, profitable and cost-effective. Among existing maintenance strategies, reliability centred maintenance is regarded as best for offshore wind turbines, delivering corrective and proactive (i.e. preventive and predictive) maintenance techniques enabling wind turbines to achieve high availability and low cost of energy. Reliability centred maintenance analysis may demonstrate that an accurate and reliable condition monitoring system is one method to increase availability and decrease the cost of energy from wind. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop efficient and cost-effective condition monitoring techniques for wind turbines. A number of commercial wind turbine monitoring systems are available in the market, most based on existing techniques from other rotating machine industries. Other wind turbine condition monitoring reviews have been published but have not addressed the technical and commercial challenges, in particular, reliability and value for money. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap and present the wind industry with a detailed analysis of the current practical challenges with existing wind turbine condition monitoring technology.

AB A planetary gear set introduces complicated gear vibration frequency structures, especially in sequentially phased planetary gear sets. Frequency components from a fixed sensor can be enhanced and/or canceled with different planets and ring gear configurations. In this study, an amplitude modulation based formula and simple trigonometric function manipulations are used to reveal the major physical phenomena in a planetary gearbox. The formulation used in this study permits unlimited modulation indices as well as unrestricted planet passing signal responses sensed at fixed transducer locations on the gearbox. Numerical simulations and field examples are given in the end of the paper to validate the analysis. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Increasing deployment of large wind turbines (WT) offshore and in remote areas requires reliable condition monitoring (CM) techniques to guarantee the high availability of these WTs and economic return. To meet this need, much effort has been expended to improve the capability of analysing the WT CM signals. However, a fully satisfactory technique has not been achieved today. One of the major reasons is that the developed techniques still cannot provide accurate interpretation of the WT CM signals, which are usually non-linear and non-stationary in nature because of the constantly varying loads and non-linear operations of the turbines. To deal with this issue, a new data-driven signal processing technique is developed in this study based on the concepts of intrinsic time-scale decomposition (ITD) and energy operator separation algorithm (EOSA). The advantages of the proposed technique over the traditional data-driven techniques have been demonstrated and validated experimentally. It has been shown that in comparison with the Hilbert-Huang transform the combination of ITD and EOSA provided more accurate and explicit presentations of the instantaneous information of the signals tested. Thus, it provides a much improved offline tool for accurately interpreting WT CM signals.

AB Fault diagnosis is a mandatory feature in fault-tolerant systems, since it provides the information necessary for the fault isolation and system reconfiguration. Recently, permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) drives have achieved prominence in wind energy conversion systems (WECSs), due to their reliability and availability. In this paper, a new approach is proposed for current sensor fault diagnosis in PMSG drives for WECSs. As opposed to the conventional state-observer-based methods for current sensor faults, which require a system model and the respective parameters, the proposed diagnostic method uses the measured phase currents only. Thus, its main merits are simplicity and reliability in the diagnosis, making it suitable for real-time implementation and to trigger remedial procedures. In addition, current sensor and open-circuit faults can be distinguished, and the affected phase is effectively identified in both cases. The proposed diagnostic technique is applied to the two power converters of a conventional back-to-back topology, and its performance is analyzed by means of several experimental results.

AB Measurements of pitch motor torque and current give indirect information about the condition of the pitch system and can therefore potentially be used for condition-based maintenance. This paper presents an analysis of these measurements for a wind turbine, and the measurements are compared with a theoretical model based on aeroelastic simulations. The blade moment is found to have only minor influence on the friction in the blade bearing. The main factors affecting the static friction are the temperature and time after the latest pitch movement. Pitch motor current and torque are proportional at a constant pitch velocity, but the 10min maximum values are only approximately proportional, because the maximum values occur during acceleration and not simultaneously. These findings are important to consider, if using the pitch motor current or torque as an indicator for the pitch system health is considered. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A novel power curve monitoring method for wind turbines was developed to prevent a turbine failure in a wind farm. Compared with the existing methods, this algorithm automatically calculates the power curve limits for power curve monitoring, even when a considerable number of abnormal data are included in wind speed-output power data measured at a wind turbine. In addition, the proposed algorithm automatically generates an alarm message when the wind speed-power data measured at the wind turbine deviate from the power curve limits, particularly considering their degree of deviation from the power curve limits and the cases when the measured data hover between the Warning Zones and the Alarm Zones. We confirmed its effectiveness through its field tests.

AB We have carried out at laboratory test to study the feasibility of using thermal radiation detectors for online thermal monitoring of electrical systems in wind turbines. A 25 kW frequency converter is instrumented with a thermal camera, operating in the 8-14 mu m wavelength range, and a single-pixel thermopile sensor, operating in the 4-8 mu m wavelength range, to monitor the temperature development of the power electronics under various load sequences. Both systems performed satisfactorily with insignificant temperature deviations when compared to data from calibrated point contact sensor. With spatial averaging over a 7 mm x 7 mm for the camera and temporal averaging over 60 s for the thermopile sensor, we reduce the root mean square noise to 45 mK and 68 mK respectively. The low cost and simple operation of the thermopile sensor make it very attractive for condition monitoring applications, whereas the attractive feature of the camera is the possibility of multi-point or distributed temperature measurements.

AB Rapid expansion of wind turbines has drawn attention to reduce the operation and maintenance costs. Continuous condition monitoring of wind turbines allows for early detection of the generator faults, facilitating a proactive response, minimizing downtime and maximizing productivity. However, the weak features of incipient faults in wind turbines are always immersed in noises of the equipment and the environment. Wavelet denoising is a useful tool for incipient fault detection and its effect mainly depends on the feature separation and the noise elimination. Multiwavelets have two or more multiscaling functions and multiwavelet functions. They possess the properties of orthogonality, symmetry, compact support and high vanishing moments simultaneously. The data-driven block threshold selected the optimal block length and threshold at different decomposition levels by using the minimum Stein's unbiased risk estimate. A multiwavelet denoising technique with the data-driven block threshold was proposed in this paper. The simulation experiment and the feature detection of a rolling bearing with a slight inner race defect indicated that the proposed method successfully detected the weak features of incipient faults.

AB Modulations present in vibration signals generated by rotating machinery might carry a lot of useful information about objects' technical condition. It has been proven that both gearboxes and rolling element bearing (REB) faults manifest themselves as modulations. The paper describes a technique for detection of modulations in vibroacoustic signals, called modulation intensity distribution (MID), which is a function that combines multiple spectral correlation densities in one way or another, depending on the application. Additionally, the paper describes a functional obtained by integrating an MID (denoted by IMID) that has the advantage of being a function of only one frequency variable instead of two. The paper investigates the utility of the MID as an indicator for detection of the presence of rolling element bearing faults in high noise environments. For the purpose of testing, a wind turbine that suffered both advanced gearbox fault and early stage of bearing fault was chosen. Additionally, the paper undertakes the problem of application of the proposed tool in an industrial condition-monitoring system. In order to show the behavior of cyclic components generated by the turbine under study over a long period of time, the set of MIDs integrated over full range of potential carrier signals was presented as a cascade plot.

AB Wind energy has proven its viability by the emergence of countless wind turbines around the world which greatly contribute to the increased electrical generating capacity of wind farm operators. These infrastructures are usually deployed in not easily accessible areas; therefore, maintenance routines should be based on a well-guided decision so as to minimize cost. To aid operators prior to the maintenance process, a condition monitoring system should be able to accurately reflect the actual state of the wind turbine and its major components in order to execute specific preventive measures using as little resources as possible. In this paper, we propose a fault detection approach which combines cluster analysis and frequent pattern mining to accurately reflect the deteriorating condition of a wind turbine and to indicate the components that need attention. Using SCADA data, we extracted operational status patterns and developed a rule repository for monitoring wind turbine systems. Results show that the proposed scheme is able to detect the deteriorating condition of a wind turbine as well as to explicitly identify faulty components.

ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS
AB This paper presents a method of fault detection and isolation for a direct-driven wind turbine (DWT) bearing. Computed order tracking is employed to convert the non-stationary envelope signal in the time domain into a quasi-stationary signal in the angular domain by even-angle resampling. Cyclostationary demodulation is then utilized to expose the orders related to fault characteristics in the demodulation spectrum. In order to realize the automatic fault diagnosis and emit a stable alarm about bearing damage, the peak value of the demodulation spectrum is scaled and compared to a defined threshold. The significant advantage of the proposed method is the implementation of an automatic algorithm for DWT bearing diagnostics under randomly varying speed and highly alternating load. Practical applications are provided to show that the proposed approach is able to achieve reliable failure warning in the bearing condition monitoring of a DWT.

AB This paper presents a low-cost, inline, gearbox lubrication monitoring sensor. The purpose of the research was to develop a sensor that can analyze wear particles suspended in gearbox lubricant systems. Current inline sensor systems rely on methods that prevent significant morphological classification. The size and shape of the particles are often indicative of the type of wear that is occurring and is therefore significant in assessing the gearbox state. A demonstration sensor consisting of a webcam that uses an active pixel sensor combined with a rectangular cross section optically transparent acrylic pipe was developed. A rig that simulates a gearbox lubrication system was used to test the sensor. Images of wear particles suspended in the lubricant were captured in real time. Image analysis was then performed to distinguish particles from the lubricant medium. Object characteristics, such as area and major axis length, were used to determine shape parameters. It was found that the sensor could detect particles down to a major axis length of 125 mu m. Classification was also demonstrated for four basic shapes: square, circular, rectangular and ellipsoidal. ellipsoidal, was also demonstrated.

AB This article deals with the atmospheric ice accumulation on wind turbine blades and its effect on the aerodynamic performance and structural response. The role of eight atmospheric and system parameters on the ice accretion profiles was estimated using the 2D ice accumulation software lewice Twenty-four hours of icing, with time varying wind speed and atmospheric icing conditions, was simulated on a rotor. Computational fluid dynamics code, FLUENT, was used to estimate the aerodynamic coefficients of the blade after icing. The results were also validated against wind tunnel measurements performed at LM Wind Power using a NACA64618 airfoil. The effects of changes in geometry and surface roughness are considered in the simulation. A blade element momentum code WT-Perf is then used to quantify the degradation in performance curves. The dynamic responses of the wind turbine under normal and iced conditions were simulated with the wind turbine aeroelastic code HAWC2. The results show different behaviors below and above rated wind speeds. In below rated wind speed, for a 5MW virtual NREL wind turbine, power loss up to 35% is observed, and the rated power is shifted from wind speed of 11 to 19ms(-1). However, the thrust of the iced rotor in below rated wind speed is smaller than the clean rotor up to 14%, but after rated wind speed, it is up to 40% bigger than the clean rotor. Finally, it is briefly indicated how the results of this paper can be used for condition monitoring and ice detection. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI S-Transform and its contribution to wind turbine condition monitoring

DE Wind turbine; Condition monitoring; S-transform; Principal component
   analysis
ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; LOCALIZATION
AB Condition monitoring (CM) has long been recognised as one of the best methods of reducing the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of wind turbines (WTs). However, its potential in the wind industry has not been fully exploited. One of the major reasons is due to the lack of an efficient tool to properly process the WT CM signals, which are usually non-stationary in both time and frequency domains owing to the constantly varying operational and loading conditions experienced by WTs. For this reason, S-transform and its potential contribution to WT CM are researched in this paper. Following the discussion of the superiorities of S-transform to the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Wavelet Transform, two S-transform based CM techniques are developed, dedicated for use on WTs. One is for tracking the energy variations of those fault-related characteristic frequencies under varying operational conditions (the energy rise of these frequencies usually indicates the presence of a fault); another is for assessing the health condition of WT gears and bearings, which have shown significant reliability issues in both onshore and offshore wind projects. In the paper, both proposed techniques have been verified experimentally, showing that they are valid for detecting both the mechanical and electrical faults occurring in the WT despite its varying operational and loading conditions.

AB As the use of wind power has steadily increased, the importance of a condition monitoring and fault diagnosis system is being emphasized to maximize the availability and reliability of wind turbines. To develop novel algorithms for fault detection and lifespan estimation, a wind turbine simulator is indispensible for verification of the proposed algorithms before introducing them into a health monitoring and integrity diagnosis system. In this paper, a new type of simulator is proposed to develop and verify advanced diagnosis algorithms. The simulator adopts a torque control method for a motor and inverter to realize variable speed-variable pitch control strategies. Unlike conventional motor-generator configurations, the simulator includes several kinds of components and a variety of sensors. Specifically, it has similarity to a 3 MW wind turbine, thereby being able to acquire a state of operation that closely resembles that of the actual 3 MW wind turbine operated at various wind conditions. This paper presents the design method for the simulator and its control logic. The experimental comparison between the behavior of the simulator and that of a wind turbine shows that the proposed control logic performs successfully and the dynamic behaviors of the simulator have similar trends as those of the wind turbine.

AB Reliability and availability of modern wind turbines are of increasing importance, for two reasons. The first is due to the fact that power grids around in the world depends at a higher and higher degree on wind energy, and the second is the importance of lowering Cost of Energy of the wind turbines. One of the critical components in modern wind turbines is the gearbox. Failures in the gearbox are costly both due to the cost of the gearbox itself, but also due to lost power generation during repair of it. Wind turbine gearboxes are consequently monitored by condition monitoring systems operating in parallel with the control system, and also uses additional sensors measuring different accelerations and noises, etc. In this paper gearbox data from high fidelity gearbox model of a 750 kW wind turbine gearbox, simulated with and without faults are used to shown the potential of frequency based detection schemes applied on measurements normally available in a wind controller system. This paper shows that two given faults in the gearbox can be detected using a frequency based detection approach applied to sensor signals normally available in the wind turbine control system. This means that gearbox condition monitoring/ fault detection could be included in the standard control system, which potentially can remove the cost of the additional condition monitoring system and the additional sensors used in it.

AB Effective vibration based condition monitoring applied to the planetary stage of a wind turbine gearbox has been historically difficult. Numerous complications associated with the low speed and variable speed nature of a wind turbine gearbox as well as the many sources of vibration signal modulation and poor vibration transmission paths within the planetary stage itself have presented complex challenges around effectively monitoring the health of planetary stage components. The focus of this paper is the vibration behavior of planetary stage gear related damage and how this behavior can be accurately identified using vibration data. The theory behind this behavior and a case history showing the successful detection of planet gear damage and ring gear damage is presented. The damage detailed in this case is clearly identifiable in the data provided by the ADAPT.Wind condition monitoring system. Although this type of damage requires a gearbox replacement, prompt detection is important to avoid the risk of splitting the gearbox casing and damaging additional wind turbine components.

AB This paper presents a cost benefit analysis for wind turbine condition monitoring systems. It is widely acknowledged that performing proactive maintenance actions can reduce the number and severity of wind turbine failures. However, the use of condition monitoring systems to determine the health of the system is often viewed as costly and of little financial benefit. In this analysis the increased costs associated with condition monitoring were offset by the positive effect of early fault detection, with faults being detected before they reach a critical stage. The continual growth in turbine output and the emergence of far-offshore wind farm sites make the economic case for cost of energy reduction from timely and accurate fault detection ever stronger.
   An assessment of the capability of the monitoring system was undertaken through allowance for the true to false condition monitoring detection ratio and the ability of the system to detect the severity of a fault. The analysis also compared onshore and offshore assets where the access availability can severely influence the downtime.
   The results show a clear financial justification for wind turbine condition monitoring and indicate the successful detection ratio required before a condition monitoring system can offer a financial benefit.

AB In a modern wind turbine, the gearbox is an expensive and fault-prone subsystem. Currently, condition monitoring, based on comparison of data of healthy baseline measurement and online measurement, followed by feature analysis and decision making, is the main approach of diagnosis and prognosis. Although having been employed in many practical implementations, such methods have limitations. For example, a huge database is needed when operating conditions change and normal variations are significant. Traditionally, first-principle-based modeling of gearboxes is considered very challenging, primarily due to their dynamic characteristics that exhibit time-periodicity and encompass a very wide frequency range. In this research, aiming at achieving the predictive modeling capability, a lumped-parameter model of a two-stage laboratory gearbox testbed is constructed based on the assumed mode method. This model can characterize the gearbox dynamic effects including the time-varying mesh stiffness and backlash. The Floquet theory and harmonic balance method are then applied to analytically investigate the system dynamics, where the eigenvalues of the time-periodic gearbox are extracted and correlated to the spectral analysis results of the time-domain response prediction. This modeling approach and the associated analysis lay down a foundation for establishing hybrid dynamic model of complex gearbox systems which will further be utilized in model-based diagnosis and prognosis.

AB As a type of clean and renewable energy source, wind power is growing fast as more and more countries lay emphasis on it. At the end of 2011, the global wind energy capacity reached 238 GW, with a cumulative growth of more than 20% per year, which is certainly a respectable figure for any industry. There is an exigent need to reduce the costs of operating and maintaining wind turbines while they became one of the fastest growing sources of power production in the world today.
   Gearbox is a critical component in the transmission system of wind turbine generator. Wind turbine gearbox operates in the extreme conditions of heavy duty, low speed and non-stationary load and speed, etc., which makes it one of the components that have high failure rate. To detect the fault of gearbox, many methods have been developed, including vibration analysis, acoustic emission, oil analysis, temperature monitoring, and performance monitoring and so on. Vibration analysis is widely used in fault diagnosis process and many efforts have been made in this area. However, there are many challenging problems in detecting the failure of wind turbine gearbox. The gearbox transforms low-speed revolutions from the rotor to high-speed revolutions, for example, from 20 rpm to 1500 rpm or higher. Usually one or more planetary gear stages are adopted in a gearbox design because the load can be shared by several planet gears and the transmission ratio can get higher. One disadvantage with the planetary gear stage is that a more complex design makes the detection and specification of gearbox failure difficult. The existing fault diagnosis theory and technology for fixed-shaft gearbox cannot solve the issues in the fault diagnosis of planetary gearbox.
   The planetary stage of wind turbine gearbox consists of sun gear, ring gear and several planet gears. The planet gears not only rotate around their own centers but also revolve around the sun gear center, and the distance between each planet gear to the sensor varies all the time. This adds complexity to vibration signals and results in difficulty in finding the fault-related features. The paths through which the vibration propagates from its origin to the sensors are complex, and the gears of other stage vibrate at the same time. This makes fault features be buried in noises. Further, the extreme conditions of heavy duty, low speed, and non-stationary workload lead to evidently non-stationary phenomena in the collected vibration. Methods to assess fault severity of a gearbox should be developed so as to realize fault prognosis and estimate of the remaining useful life of gearbox. Finally, other issues like signal analysis based on multi-sensor data fusion are also considered.
   This paper gives a comprehensive investigation on the state-of-the-art development in the wind turbine gearbox condition monitoring and health evaluation. The general situation of wind energy industry is discussed, and the research progresses in each aspects of wind turbine gearbox are reviewed. The existing problems in the current research are summarized in the end.

AB Wind turbine maintenance is emerging as an unexpectedly high component of turbine operating cost and there is an increasing interest in managing this cost. Here, we present an alternative view of maintenance as a value-driver, and develop an optimization algorithm to maximize the value delivered by maintenance. We model the stochastic deterioration of the turbine in two dimensions: the deterioration rate, and the extent. of deterioration, and view maintenance as an operator that moves the turbine to an improved state in which it can generate more power and so earn more revenue. We then use a standard net present value (NPV) approach to calculate the value of the turbine by deducting the costs incurred in the installation, operations and maintenance from the revenue due to the power generation. The application of our model is demonstrated using several scenarios with a focus on blade deterioration. We evaluate the value delivered by implementing blade condition monitoring systems (CMS). A higher fidelity CMS allows the blade state to be determined with higher precision. With this improved state information, an optimal maintenance strategy can be derived. The difference between the value of the turbine with and without CMS can be interpreted as the value of the CMS. The results indicate that a higher fidelity (and more expensive) condition monitoring system (CMS) does not necessarily yield the highest value, and, that there is an optimal level of fidelity that results in maximum value. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, it is a practical approach to wind turbine valuation and operation that takes operating and market conditions into account. This work should therefore be useful to wind farm operators and investors. Second, it shows how the value of a CMS can be explicitly assessed. This work should therefore be useful to CMS manufacturers and wind farm operators.

AB The gearbox oil and the wind turbine gearbox condition are correlated. The oil can give the wind turbine operator the necessary information to plan maintenance and avoid costly repairs. Therefore, a test bench that can reproduce the gearbox operating conditions would be necessary to test oil-sensors. This paper presents a first testing approach using a Highly Accelerated Life Test / Highly Accelerated Stress Screening test chamber. It allows assessing the performance of oil properties sensors under extreme ambient temperature and vibration levels, based on measurements from a wind turbine gearbox. Results from a test on an oil properties sensor are presented and discussed. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID DOMAIN
AB Doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) are the most popular configuration met in the wind energy sector occupying approximately 6 5 % of the total market share. Condition monitoring of wind turbine generators is performed based on vibration data collected from accelerometers mounted on the drive end and non-drive end bearings, meeting the requirements of numerous turbine operators for condition based maintenance. In a DFIG the voltage applied to the rotor is controlled by a converter, where electric connection between the two is accomplished by using slip rings. Improper connection between the slip ring unit and the rotor circuit is manifested as excessive vibration seen in both ends of the generator. The consistent and accurate diagnosis of a rotor circuit malfunction is of crucial importance in regards to proper troubleshooting of the fault and the overall health of the generator. In this paper generator bearing vibration signature for a DFIG under operation with one rotor phase coil open is analysed and presented. Further this failure mode is compared to rotor dynamics fault, such as rotational looseness, and the difference in signature is discussed. Vibration data from a multi-mega watt DFIG wind turbine subjected to the above described failure mode is illustrated as scalar values and frequency spectra. It is shown that detailed analyses have resulted in a successful identification of disconnected rotor phase by detecting sidebands around the generator running speed harmonics matching the pole pass frequency.

AB Asset management of wind turbines has gained increased importance in recent years. High maintenance cost and longer downtimes of wind turbines have led to research in methods to optimize maintenance activities. Condition monitoring systems have proven to be a useful tool towards aiding maintenance management of wind turbines. Methods using Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system along with artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been developed to monitor the condition of wind turbine components. Various researchers have presented different artificial neural network (ANN) based models for condition monitoring of components in a wind turbine. This paper presents an application of the approach to decide and update the training data set needed to create an accurate ANN model. A case study with SCADA data from a real wind turbine has been presented. The results show that due to a major maintenance activity, like replacement of component, the ANN model has to be re-trained. The results show that application of the proposed approach makes it possible to update and re-train the ANN model.

AB Maintenance costs for wind power plants are a significant part of the total life cycle cost, especially for offshore wind power plants, situated at remote sites. In order to decrease the cost of maintenance, monitoring systems have been used to estimate the condition of critical components in wind turbines. This paper proposes Life Cycle Cost analysis (LCC) approach for maintenance management of wind turbines. The LCC approach for maintenance management presented in this paper is an extension on previous work by J. Nilsson and L. Bertling, where a comparison has been made with this previous work and the same is extended with new data and models. Case studies are presented based on data from three different wind turbinesrated 3 and 6MW. Three different scenarios have been studied and the effect of condition monitoring system (CMS) has been analysed. For any chosen value the CMS proves to be a profitable option.

AB Wind power is one of the fastest growing renewable energy sources. Wind turbine blades and heights have been increased steadily in the last 10 years in order to increase the capacity of wind power generator. So, the amount of wind turbine energy is increased by increasing the capacity of wind turbine generator, but the preventive, corrective and replacement maintenance cost is increased by that's reasons. Recently, Condition Monitoring System (CMS) can repair the fault and diagnose of wind turbine that introduce to solve these problems. However, these systems have a problem that cannot predict and diagnose of the wind turbine faults. In this paper, wind turbine fault prediction methodology is proposed by using the SVM method. In the case study, wind turbine fault and external environmental factors are analysed by using the SVM method.

AB Wind power becomes one of the most important cleaner energy in the world. The maintenance problem becomes the main factor preventing the appropriate power price which can be accepted by people. So, many researches contribute to improve the availability of wind farms. Traditionally, most researchers paid attention to the fault diagnosis, prognosis and maintenance strategies optimization to short the down time and the maintenance cost. But they all neglect the condition monitoring work of repaired gearbox of wind turbine before it is delivered to the customer from maintenance center to the wind farm. The life of repaired gearbox is also a very critical factor which influences the availability of wind farm. Good checking methods and good standard can provide a good support of good performance after the gearbox installed on the up tower. So, this paper proposed how to address these issues.

AB We propose a fiber Bragg grating laser sensor system for possible uses in large scale wind turbine blades' condition monitoring. The measurement instability due to the sensitive multi-wavelength lasing has been greatly improved by employing a polarization scrambling in the lasing cavity and a spectrometer demodulator. With suggested technique, we obtained 100% of data acquisition rate from all the 4 FBG laser sensors along single fiber-optic cable. Also the noise characteristics of the sensor outputs have improved 4 times more than the previous system.

ID INTERFEROMETRY
AB Wind turbine towers are in need of condition monitoring so as to lower the cost of unexpected maintenance. Wind loading from turbulence and gusts can cause damage in horizontal axis wind turbines even the supporting towers. Monitoring of wind turbines in service using embedded data sensor arrays usually is not targeted at the turbine-tower interaction from the perspective of structural dynamics. In this study the remote monitoring of the tower supporting a horizontal-axis wind turbine was attempted using a microwave interferometer. The dominant frequency of one tower was found to be decreased by more than 20% in 16 months. Numerical modeling using spectral finite elements is in progress and should provide further information regarding frequency shift due to stiffness variation and added mass. Expected outcome will contribute to remote monitoring procedures and nondestructive evaluation techniques for local wind turbine structures during operation.

AB Different signal processing methods are applied to experimental data obtained from a rolling element bearing rig in order to perform damage detection. Among these methods the Teager-Kaiser energy operator is also proposed as a more novel approach. This energy operator is an amplitude-frequency demodulation method used in this paper as an alternative to the Hilbert Transform in order to perform envelope analysis on the datasets analysed.

AB The blades are crucial components of a wind turbine, and its steady and reliable operation is directly related to the power output. Thus, condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of the wind turbine blades is highly beneficial to the operational cost. This paper presents a study of small horizontal axis wind turbine blade rotational speed measurement by laser Doppler velocimeter based on dual-core photonic crystal fiber (DC-PCF). The theory on the DC-PCF Doppler velocimeter is presented, and the measurement system is designed and tested. Experimental results show that the DC-PCF Doppler velocimeter has been proved to work successfully. The uncertainty of the rotational speed is about 0 similar to 4 rpm. The accuracy can meet the requirements for monitoring the rotational operation of the wind turbine.

AB For wind farms, wind turbine condition monitoring is important to reduce maintenance costs and improve the competitiveness in the electricity market, particularly for offshore wind farms. This paper seeks to establish wind turbine gearbox temperature model under the normal working state using Gaussian process, the forecast and evaluation of temperature is also described. Within the Bayesian context, the paper aims to training Gaussian process, using the maximum likelihood optimized approach to find the optimal hyperparameters. For large-scale regression tasks, a novel method using Cholesky decomposition to avoid ill-conditioned matrix is described. Another method using matrix caching to speed up the inverse of matrix calculation is proposed. In addition, the optimized Gaussian model is used to predict the gearbox validation data and compare with SVM (support vector machine) and BPNN (neural network) this two methods. By comparing the simulation results, Gaussian process gearbox temperature model demonstrates higher prediction accuracy. The model is a valuable object for condition monitoring.

AB It is important that the impact of the offshore environment on wind turbine reliability is reduced significantly due to the importance of offshore wind deployment to global energy targets. Future development may otherwise be compromised by unsustainable operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. This paper aims to improve the accuracy of offshore O&M models by accounting for any relationship between certain weather characteristics and wind turbine failure modes. This is done using maintenance data from a UK onshore wind farm and weather data from a weather station located nearby. Non-parametric Mixture Models are estimated from the data and they are used to calculate a more accurate, weather dependent, failure rate which will be used in future research for Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation. This research will be of particular interest to wind turbine operators and manufacturers.

AB Wind turbine condition monitoring is essential task in the process of maintaining machine operation at the optimal level. It is related to ensuring the profitability of investment and the provision of security in the environment of the turbine. However, operational conditions of turbine associated with non-stationary nature of the stimulus which is the wind, impede the correct diagnosis of the machine. In addition, a multitude of parameters adversely affects the clarity of predictions and setting alarm thresholds. In the article, the authors evaluate the impact of generator output power and rotational speed on selected vibration-based feature value. The study was performed for wind turbine planetary gearbox during fault development of the ring. It was possible due to historical data consisting peak-to-peak (P2P) values together with corresponding values of rotational speed and generator output power. For the purpose of the experiment the method that bases on calculation of arithmetic mean of the data in the segments corresponding to the chosen ranges of both rotational speed and generator output power is presented. Results are given in the form of three-dimensional charts, which allow assessing the impact of parameters on the studied feature. The paper shows that for machinery operating under varying regime proposed representation might serve as a valuable method for fault detection. Additionally, authors highlight the importance of analysis of vibration-based features as a function of two variables (rotational speed and power/load).

DE Machine operational states; Condition monitoring of machinery working
   under non-stationary parameters
AB A reliable evaluation of technical condition of machinery working under non-stationary conditions requires a rigorous tracking of operational parameters. Therefore, modern condition monitoring systems (CMS) enable reading and registering of process parameters (e. g. speed, load, pressure, etc.) in parallel with acquisition of vibroacoustic signals. Although few tries have been undertaken to develop state-free analysis of vibration signals, currently installed systems still do rely on state-preclassified data. The paper shows how the process, referential data might be automatically transformed into proposition of optimal machine operational states in terms of their number and their range. As indicated by the title, the paper shows common pitfalls coming from implementation of popular clustering approach. The proposed algorithm illustrates is verified on real data from a pitch-controlled wind turbine.

AB The monitoring of wind energy production is fundamental to improve the performances of a wind farm during the operational phase. In order to perform reliable operational analysis, data mining of all available information spreading out from turbine control systems is required. In this work a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data analysis was performed on a small wind farm and new post-processing methods are proposed for condition monitoring of the aero-generators. Indicators are defined to detect the malfunctioning of a wind turbine and to select meaningful data to investigate the causes of the anomalous behaviour of a turbine. The operating state database is used to collect information about the proper power production of a wind turbine, becoming a tool that can be used to verify if the contractual obligations between the original equipment manufacturer and the wind farm operator are met. Results demonstrate that a proper selection of the SCADA data can be very useful to measure the real performances of a wind farm and thus to define optimal repair/replacement and preventive maintenance policies that play a major role in case of energy production.

DE Wind turbine; Damage detection; Operational modal analysis; Fault
   simulation
AB Operational Modal Analysis (OMA), also known as output-only modal analysis, allows identifying modal parameters only by using the response measurements of the structures in operational conditions when the input forces cannot be measured. These information can then be used to improve numerical models in order to monitor the operating and structural conditions of the system. This is a critical aspect both for condition monitoring and maintenance of large wind turbines, particularly in the off-shore sector where operation and maintenance represent a high percentage of total costs. Although OMA is widely applied, the wind turbine case still remains an open issue. Numerical aeroelastic models could be used, once they have been validated, to introduce virtual damages to the structures in order to analyze the generated data. Results from such models can then be used as baseline to monitor the operating and structural condition of the machine.

AB Wind energy is a renewable energy that growing fast across the whole world, but its subsystems experience premature failures during its 20-year design life, leading downtime and costly maintain and repair. Since gearbox is the subsystem who causes the longest downtime, condition monitoring (CM) of the gearbox to prevent catastrophic failures is critical to wind energy. Based on vibration analysis, this paper presents a practical CM technique for faulty gear and faulty bearing detection of wind turbine gearbox. The algorithms studied in this paper have been successfully applied on signals from a field test of a full-size wind turbine gearbox who sustained gear and bearing damage, showing a good engineering prospect.

AB Order tracking analysis has been demonstrated to be suitable for wind turbine gearbox fault diagnosis, but in traditional way, a keyphasor signal is indispensable. In some real cases, due to harsh working environment and installation space limitation, it's hard to acquire this keyphasor signal. To overcome this problem, raw speed profile is used in this paper to synthesize the keyphasor, by assuming that the first pulse signal is at time zero, once the arriving time of the ith pulse is known, calculate the next pulse arrival time in two different ways, then minimizing the difference of these two results to get the next pulse arrival time. By assuming the shaft angular acceleration is constant between three consecutive pulses and using the synthesized keyphasor above, this paper successfully fulfill order tracking analysis on a United Stated MW-class wind turbine gearbox without keyphasor signal, which shows a very good engineering practicability.

AB Due to the increase in the number of failures in the wind turbine generators, the condition monitoring system plays a significant role in overcoming the negative effects resulting from the difficult operation conditions. Mechanical and electrical properties can be combined to detect the faults coming from wind turbine generators by analyzing their behavior under different (normal and abnormal) operation conditions. Studying the trend and effect of the electrical torque pulsations on wind turbine generators under different conditions allows for a proper condition monitoring. In this paper, different methodology has been adopted to develop a proper condition monitoring system on the wind generators by evaluating the generator electrical torque based on mechanical torque and taking into account the acceleration torque, which has not been considered in previous work. Using the electric torque with respect to the rotor angular speed of the generator, when it is running under different operation conditions, indicates the generator health, which is the main methodology of the proposed work. A case study, which is based upon collected data from actual measurements, is presented in this work in order to demonstrate the adequacy of the proposed model.

AB This paper focuses on the theoretical analysis of wind turbine radar signatures in the near-field. This is a first step towards the development of a close-range radar system which can detect, and potentially classify wind turbine structural faults. A simplified theoretical model of the wind turbine radar signature under such conditions is presented, which relates radar signal parameters to actual wind turbine mechanical properties. The theoretical model is experimentally confirmed using scaled turbine models in an anechoic chamber.

TI Wind turbine condition monitoring based on SCADA data using normal

AB This paper is part two of a two part series. The originality of part one was the proposal of a novelty approach for wind turbine supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data mining for condition monitoring purposes. The novelty concerned the usage of adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference system (ANFIS) models in this context and the application of a proposed procedure to a wide range of different SCADA signals. The applicability of the set up ANFIS models for anomaly detection was proven by the achieved performance of the models. In combination with the fuzzy interference system (FIS) proposed the prediction errors provide information about the condition of the monitored components.
   Part two presents application examples illustrating the efficiency of the proposed method. The work is based on continuously measured wind turbine SCADA data from 18 modern type pitch regulated wind turbines of the 2 MW class covering a period of 35 months. Several real life faults and issues in this data are analyzed and evaluated by the condition monitoring system (CMS) and the results presented. It is shown that SCADA data contain crucial information for wind turbine operators worth extracting. Using full signal reconstruction (FSRC) adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference system (ANFIS) normal behavior models (NBM) in combination with fuzzy logic (FL) a setup is developed for data mining of this information. A high degree of automation can be achieved. It is shown that FL rules established with a fault at one turbine can be applied to diagnose similar faults at other turbines automatically via the CMS proposed. A further focus in this paper lies in the process of rule optimization and adoption, allowing the expert to implement the gained knowledge in fault analysis. The fault types diagnosed here are: (1) a hydraulic oil leakage; (2) cooling system filter obstructions; (3) converter fan malfunctions; (4) anemometer offsets and (5) turbine controller malfunctions. Moreover, the graphical user interface (GUI) developed to access, analyze and visualize the data and results is presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Online condition monitoring is a crucial task for wind turbine generators availability and reliability enhancement and leads to an early electrical and mechanical faults detection which can reduce the maintenance cost and avoids catastrophic failures. The performance of any condition monitoring system should be evaluated before its installation on an actual full-scale system. Therefore, the design of a reduced-scale wind turbine generator including its main subsystem components at initial stage is important for the assessment of new methods dedicated to electrical and mechanical faults prediction and detection in wind turbine generators. This paper aims to develop a test bench to accomplish this goal. A doubly-fed wound rotor induction generator configuration is selected since it is the dominate technology currently used in the market. The system includes required instrumentations as well as a real-time platform for development of any sophisticated condition monitoring strategy devoted to online condition monitoring of main parts of a wind turbine generator.

AB Nowadays, the importance of real time condition monitoring and control for wind turbine (WT) is increasing because WTs are installed on remote site such as mountains and offshore. In this paper, we implement a monitoring and control system for a small-scale wind turbine. The monitoring and control system consists of data collection units, control unit and coordinator. The data collection units collect data from various sensors: temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind direction, wind speed and vibration. And the data collection units transmit sensing data to a coordinator. A ZigBee is used to communicate between a coordinator and data collection units. The coordinator is also communicate with PC and smart device through RS232 and Bluetooth, respectively. The GUI is implemented based on Android and LabVIEW to show the sensing data. The GUI based on LabVIEW can control the wind turbine direction using control unit.

AB For wind farms, the relationship between wind speed and output can be described by power curve of wind turbines, and it is an important embodiment of power performance of wind turbines. Based on the mathematical model of the power curve of wind turbine, monitoring performance of the wind turbine can be designed. Power curve model of wind turbines can be established by using Gaussian process. Within the Bayesian context, the paper aims to train the Gaussian process by using the maximum likelihood optimized approach to find the optimal hyperparameters. The model was validated by the data. Finally, based on the wind turbine power curve mathematical model, the states of the wind turbine can be monitored by using the technology of control charts.

AB Bearings consist one of the most widely used industrial rotating machine elements, especially rolling bearings and journal bearings. The capability to detect fast, accurately and easily the existence and severity of bearing fault during operation is very important as an unexpected failure of machine can lead to significant economic losses. This paper mainly introduces an actual case study of bearing condition monitoring in industry. As an effective tool in inspection the bearing condition, shock pulse method (SPM) is utilized to monitor the bearings of test rig which includes an electric motor and a wind turbine. Through analysing the frequency spectrum derived from the SPM instrument, the faulty bearing is located accurately. The case study validates that SPM is quite effective for monitoring the bearings condition in industrial applications.

AB Wind energy conversion is the fastest growing source of electricity generation in the world among the other renewable energy production technologies. Whereas investment costs have decreased over years, operational and maintenance costs of wind turbines are still high, thus attracting the focus of researchers and industrial operators.
   Classical maintenance techniques, i.e.: run-to-failure and scheduled-preventive maintenance, are still dominant in this sector; however, condition monitoring has gained space in the wind turbine market and new diagnostic methods and techniques are continuously being proposed. Condition monitoring techniques seem the most effective tools to minimize operational and maintenance costs and reduce downtimes by early detection of faults.
   This paper is aimed at reviewing the state of the art of condition monitoring for horizontal axis wind turbines. After a brief introduction presenting the current trends in the market of wind energy, the paper reviews the most common failure modes of wind turbines and the traditional approach to maintenance. The core of this study details the state of the art in the field of system architectures, sensors and signal processing techniques for the diagnostic of faults in wind turbine components. Finally, some general conclusions are drawn on the overall trends in the field of condition monitoring of wind turbines.

AB Condition monitoring of a wind turbine is important to extend the wind turbine system's reliability and useful life. However, in many cases, to extract feature components becomes challenging and the applicability of information drops down due to the large amount of noise. Stochastic resonance (SR), used as a method of utilising noise to amplify weak signals in nonlinear systems, can detect weak signals overwhelmed in the noise. Therefore, a new noise-controlled second-order enhanced SR method based on the Morlet wavelet transform is proposed to extract fault feature for wind turbine vibration signals in the present study. The second-order SR method can obtain better denoising effect and higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of resonance output by means of twice integral transform compared with the traditional SR method. Morlet wavelet transform can obtain finer frequency partitions and overcome the frequency aliasing compared with the classical wavelet transform. Therefore, through Morlet wavelet transform, the noise intensity of different scales can be adjusted to realize the resonance detection of weak periodic signal whatever it is a low-frequency signal or high-frequency signal. Thus the method is well-suited for enhancement of weak fault identification, whose effectiveness has been verified by the practical vibration signals carrying fault information. Finally, the proposed method has been applied to extract feature of the looseness fault of shaft coupling of wind turbine successfully. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID DESIGN
AB Renewable energy sources especially wind energy have gained much attention due to the recent energy crisis and the urge to obtain clean energy. To maintain the wind turbine in operation healthily, implementation of condition monitoring system and fault detection system is necessary. In wind turbine condition monitoring, vibration analysis is a common and affective way to apply in the feature extraction and fault diagnosis, especially in the rotation parts. The blade-cabin-tower coupling system is analyzed in this paper. At first, the coordinate system and the kinetic equation are established. The tower natural frequency is calculated based on the coordinate system and the random following wind vibration is analyzed. In the end, the total wind force in blade-cabin-tower coupling system is solved. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DRIVE SYSTEMS; MACHINES
AB Increasing the availability of multi-megawatt wind turbines (WT) is necessary if the cost of energy generated by wind is to be reduced. It has been found that WT generator bearings have a surprisingly high failure rate, with failures happening too early to be due to classical rolling contact fatigue. One potentially important root cause of bearings failures, bearing currents, has been investigated in this paper. The use of pulse-width modulated power electronic converters in variable speed WTs results in the presence of a common-mode voltage which may drive stray currents through a parasitic circuit in the generator structure. In this paper it is shown that if appropriate mitigation strategies are not employed, the bearing lubricant may experience electric stress in excess of its dielectric strength resulting in electrostatic discharge machining (EDM) of the bearing. Moreover it is shown that rotor-fed machines are more susceptible than stator-fed machines due to the presence of a larger coupling capacitance in the stray circuit. This is significant due to the prevalence of doubly fed induction generator WTs. The need for further research in this area, particularly in order to quantify the damage caused by EDM and develop diagnostic and prognostic techniques for the application of condition monitoring to this phenomenon, has been demonstrated.

AB Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are currently considered crucial means to increase the reliability and availability of wind turbines and, consequently, to reduce the wind energy cost. With similar goals, direct-drive wind turbines based on permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) with full-scale power converters are an emerging and promising technology. Numerous studies show that power converters are a significant contributor to the overall failure rate of modern wind turbines. In this context, open-circuit fault diagnosis in the two power converters of a PMSG drive for wind turbine applications is addressed in this paper. A diagnostic method is proposed for each power converter, allowing real-time detection and localization of multiple open-circuit faults. The proposed methods are suitable for integration into the drive controller and triggering remedial actions. In order to prove the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnostic methods, several simulation and experimental results are presented.

TI Wind Turbine Condition and Power Quality Monitoring by the Approach of

AB Increasing deployment of wind turbines requires efficient condition monitoring to ensure the safety and availability of these machines. Grid code also requests the operator to enhance the monitoring of the quality of the power generated by the wind turbine. Most commercially available wind turbine condition monitoring systems are supported by a number of vibration transducers. They consequently are complex in hardware, expensive in price, but inefficient in computation and particularly lack of power quality monitoring ability. In view of this, an innovative electrical signal analysis-based wind turbine condition and power quality monitoring technique is developed in this paper by the approach of individual harmonic extraction. The proposed technique has been verified in the lab by applying to detecting both the mechanical and electrical faults emulated on a specially designed wind turbine condition monitoring test rig. Experiments show that the proposed technique is not only sensitive to the faults, but alert to the degradation of power quality.

AB Latest development of distributed condition monitoring for heavy duty machinery has revealed a major challenge concerning reliable data acquisition. Due to frequent failures of diagnostic algorithms caused by incorrectly registered data, validation of vibration signals became a very attractive field of research. The paper shows how classical data acquisition procedures might be enhanced by implementation of signal validation methods based on both machine process parameters signals and machine vibration signals. Presented validation covers analysis of process parameters, data stability constrains and also independent and comparative validation of vibration signals. Benefits of applied techniques are illustrated on real data from a wind turbine. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Four data-mining approaches for wind turbine power curve monitoring are compared. Power curve monitoring can be applied to evaluate the turbine power output and detect deviations, causing financial loss. In this research, cluster center fuzzy logic, neural network, and kappa-nearest neighbor models are built and their performance compared against literature. Recently developed adaptive neuro-fuzzy-interference system models are set up and their performance compared with the other models, using the same data. Literature models often neglect the influence of the ambient temperature and the wind direction. The ambient temperature can influence the power output up to 20%. Nearby obstacles can lower the power output for certain wind directions. The approaches proposed in literature and the ANFIS models are compared by using wind speed only and two additional inputs. The comparison is based on the mean absolute error, root mean squared error, mean absolute percentage error, and standard deviation using data coming from three pitch regulated turbines rating 2 MW each. The ability to highlight performance deviations is investigated by use of real measurements. The comparison shows the decrease of error rates and of the ANFIS models when taking into account the two additional inputs and the ability to detect faults earlier.

AB Offshore wind energy is catching increasing worldwide interest. However, access and maintenance offshore can be difficult and will be more costly than onshore, and hence, availability is correspondingly lower. As a result, there is a growing interest in wind turbine condition monitoring with condition-based rather than responsive and scheduled maintenance. A non-linear state estimation technique (NSET) model is presented here to model a healthy wind turbine gearbox using stored historical data. These data capture the inter-relationship between the model input and output parameters. The state vectors comprising the data should cover as much as turbine operational range, including the extreme conditions in order to obtain an accurate model performance. A model so constructed can be applied to assess the operational data. Welch's t-test is employed in the fault detection algorithm, together with suitable time series filtering, to identify incipient anomalies in the turbine gearbox before they develop into catastrophic faults. Two case studies based on 10-minute supervisory control and data acquisition data from a commercial wind farm are presented to demonstrate the model's effectiveness. Comparison is made with neural network modelling, and the NSET approach is demonstrated to be superior.

AB The study of pollution performance on a wind turbine blade due to lightning is important, as it can cause major damage to wind turbine blades. In the present work, optical emission spectroscopy (OES) technique is used to understand the influence of pollutant deposited on a wind turbine blade in an off-shore environment. A methodical experimental study was carried out by adopting IEC 60507 standards, and it was observed that the lightning discharge propagates at the interface between the pollutant and the glass fiber reinforced plastic (Material used in manufacturing of wind turbine blades). In addition, as a diagnostic condition monitoring technique, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is proposed and demonstrated to rank the severity of pollutant on the wind turbine blades from a remote area. Optical emission spectra observed during surface discharge process induced by lightning impulse voltage is in agreement with the spectra observed during LIBS.

AB Certain parts of a wind turbine, for example, the gearbox require significant time and heavy lifting equipment in the event of catastrophic failure necessitating replacement. Continuous condition monitoring has the potential to catch problems early, enable scheduled preventative maintenance and thereby reduce turbine downtime, reduce the number of site visits and prevent secondary damage. Accelerometers applied to mechanical components of the drive train are traditionally used for condition monitoring, but require their own data acquisition system and analysis software. In contrast, the electrical current and voltage are continuously measured and could also be used for condition monitoring more cheaply. An experimental data acquisition system has been installed on a small (25 kW) onshore turbine in Leicestershire, UK to compare three-phase currents and voltages on the stator windings with six accelerometer signals. Data have been recorded before and after a gearbox failure and replacement. Data were analysed using both Fourier transform and Morlet continuous wavelet transform methods. Results show that the stator voltages show the same radial and axial mode vibration frequencies as the accelerometers, and could therefore be used for condition monitoring. Furthermore, the stator currents show torsional modes of vibration not picked up by the accelerometers.

AB Concerns amongst wind turbine (WT) operators about gearbox reliability arise from complex repair procedures, high replacement costs and long downtimes leading to revenue losses. Therefore, reliable monitoring for the detection, diagnosis and prediction of such faults are of great concerns to the wind industry. Monitoring of WT gearboxes has gained importance as WTs become larger and move to more inaccessible locations. This paper summarizes typical WT gearbox failure modes and reviews supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and condition monitoring system (CMS) approaches for monitoring them. It then presents two up-to-date monitoring case studies, from different manufacturers and types of WT, using SCADA and CMS signals.
   The first case study, applied to SCADA data, starts from basic laws of physics applied to the gearbox to derive robust relationships between temperature, efficiency, rotational speed and power output. The case study then applies an analysis, based on these simple principles, to working WTs using SCADA oil temperature rises to predict gearbox failure.
   The second case study focuses on CMS data and derives diagnostic information from gearbox vibration amplitudes and oil debris particle counts against energy production from working WTs.
   The results from the two case studies show how detection, diagnosis and prediction of incipient gearbox failures can be carried out using SCADA and CMS signals for monitoring although each technique has its particular strengths. It is proposed that in the future, the wind industry should consider integrating WT SCADA and CMS data to detect, diagnose and predict gearbox failures.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS
AB Condition-based maintenance is an effective way to reduce operation and maintenance cost of wind turbine. Highly complex and non-stationary operational conditions of wind turbine pose a challenge to conventional condition monitoring technique. Thus, a systematic multi-parameter health condition evaluation framework that considers the dynamic operational conditions is proposed. After characteristic parameter selection and Gaussian mixture model based multi-regime modeling, evidential reasoning is developed to evaluate the health condition of wind turbine. The proposed approach shows good health condition evaluation performance not only on the parameter level but also on the component and system level. Case studies indicate the effectiveness and potential applications of the proposed method for the wind turbine health condition evaluation. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

DT Article
DE Condition monitoring; Wind turbine; SCADA
AB Wind turbines are being increasingly deployed in remote onshore and offshore areas due to the richer wind resource there and the advantages of mitigating the land use and visual impact issues. However, site accessing difficulties and the shortage of proper transportation and installation vehicles/vessels are challenging the operation and maintenance of the giants erected at these remote sites. In addition to the continual pressure on lowering the cost of energy of wind, condition monitoring is being regarded as one of the best solutions for the maintenance issues and therefore is attracting significant interest today. Much effort has been made in developing wind turbine condition monitoring systems and inventing dedicated condition monitoring technologies. However, the high cost and the various capability limitations of available achievements have delayed their extensive use. A cost-effective and reliable wind turbine condition monitoring technique is still sought for today. The purpose of this paper is to develop such a technique through interpreting the SCADA data collected from wind turbines, which have already been collected but have long been ignored due to lack of appropriate data interpretation tools. The major contributions of this paper include: (1) develop an effective method for processing raw SCADA data; (2) propose an alternative condition monitoring technique based on investigating the correlations among relevant SCADA data; and (3) realise the quantitative assessment of the health condition of a turbine under varying operational conditions. Both laboratory and site verification tests have been conducted. It has been shown that the proposed technique not only has a potential powerful capability in detecting incipient wind turbine blade and drive train faults, but also exhibits an amazing ability in tracing their further deterioration.

AB Implementation of a condition monitoring system is a difficult decision due to many uncertain parameters. This is certainly the case for the wind turbine industry where factors like long logistical times and weather conditions have a major influence on the economic benefit. One of the parameters that is neglected in most of the available literature is the performance of the condition monitoring system itself. In this paper a new concept for modeling this performance based on the P-F curve of different failure modes is presented. The concept is illustrated on an extensive case study for a gearbox of a wind turbine. A stochastic simulation model is constructed in order to quantify the economic added value of implementing an imperfectly performing condition monitoring system into a gearbox. This case study proves that a condition monitoring system generates an economic benefit compared to the currently applied maintenance strategy. However, the magnitude of this benefit depends strongly on the performance of the condition monitoring system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Determination of the combined vibrational and acoustic emission

AB A review of current progress in Condition Monitoring (CM) of wind turbine gearboxes and generators is presented, as an input to the design of a new continuous CM system with automated warnings based on a combination of vibrational and Acoustic Emission (AE) analysis. For wind turbines, existing reportage on vibrational monitoring is restricted to a few case histories whilst data on AE is even scarcer. In contrast, this paper presents combined vibration and AE monitoring performed over a continuous period of 5 days on a wind turbine. The vibrational and AE signatures for a healthy wind turbine gearbox and generator were obtained as a function of wind speed and turbine power, for the full normal range of these operational variables. i.e. 5-25 m/s and 0-300 kW respectively. The signatures have been determined as a vital pre-requisite for the identification of abnormal signatures attributable to shaft and gearbox defects. Worst-case standard deviations have been calculated for the sensor data. These standard deviations determine the minimum defect signal that could be detected within the defined time interval without false alarms in an automated warning system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB As the demand for wind energy continues to grow at exponential rates, reducing operation and maintenance costs and increasing reliability is now a top priority. Aside from developing more advanced wind turbines designs to improve the availability, an effective way to achieve this improvement is to apply reliable and cost-effective condition monitoring techniques. After highlighting on condition monitoring, diagnosis and maintenance theories, this paper outlines the relationship between these theories and related technical concepts. It also takes a look on new trends and future challenges in the wind turbine condition monitoring industry.

AB Fault recognition for Wind Turbine Generator's (WTG) mechanical system is a fundamental task of Condition Monitoring System and depends on the time-frequency feature of the monitored signals. A recognition method by matching the Hilbert-Huang Spectrum (HHS) of the vibration signal is proposed. Fault recognition is formulated as an aligning process that shifts the vibration's HHS to match the pre-defined fault pattern using ICP. Given that the duration and initial frequency feature of the HHS may lead to different aligning results, iteration parameters with multiple time-scales and positions are set. In simulations, a mechanical fault is identified and the effectiveness is compared. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Planetary gearboxes are required in many applications but have a high failure rate especially in wind turbines where rapid growth in turbine size is placing larger demands on the gearboxes. Current condition monitoring techniques are less effective at detecting faults in planetary gearboxes due to the complexity of the internal rotating components. A small scale planetary gearbox was, therefore, needed for testing on a gearbox test rig to develop a more effective method of condition monitoring. The detailed computer design and manufacture of the planetary gearbox for this purpose is detailed in this paper.

AB Fault diagnosis of localized defects in motor bearings using electrical current signal analysis has previously been reported in the literature. An extension of this concept is the detection of faults in mechanical components influencing the operation of an induction motor, such as a gearbox connected to the motor, using electrical current.
   This paper presents a dynamic model-based approach to quantify the severity of upstream mechanical equipment faults on electrical current-based fault diagnosis metrics, using a wind turbine system as an example. A lumped parameter-based dynamic model was used to develop the system of equations representing the rotational motion of the drive train components in a wind turbine. This mechanical model was coupled with a dynamic model for a doubly-fed induction generator to simulate the electrical current output under faulty operating conditions. The changes in the fault diagnosis metric under different levels of severity of the fault were investigated. The influence of faults in multiple gears of the gearbox on the electrical current signals was also investigated. This method can be advantageous compared with existing approaches involving vibration analysis because it is a non-invasive and remote monitoring approach, and may not even require additional instrumentation. This approach is particularly useful for wind turbine operators as well as designers seeking to implement a low-cost condition monitoring solution for gear fault detection in a wind turbine.

AB Wind turbines are fundamental components of power conversion. With the increasing number of wind turbines worldwide, the exposure to harsh environmental conditions and the use of remote areas like offshore, arctic or desert regions, it has become important to predict abnormal machine behaviour as early as possible. Therefore, automated fault detection is necessary. Fault detection will prevent extensive damage in case of a fault and create time to react to faults, for example, to prepare inspections and/or to purchase spare parts. To reduce the downtime of wind turbines, fault detection systems are already widely used but more research and development need to be done. The diagnostic approach of those systems is to use pre-set fixed alert thresholds but has several drawbacks and therefore makes fault isolation difficult. To overcome the drawbacks of the common systems, this paper introduces model based condition monitoring using residual generation to wind turbine drive trains. Residuals describe the difference between the measurements and the model output. The model output represents the non-faulty system behaviour. If the measurement deviates from the model output a fault is indicated. Residual generation is a known approach for other systems. A mathematical model of a system, such as a wind turbine drive train, depends on the actual and past machine operation as well as on the ambient conditions. By knowing these conditions and being able to describe them in an analytic way, a model can be derived using the well-known state-space representation.

AB As the demand for wind energy continues to grow at exponential rates, reducing operation and maintenance costs and increasing reliability is now a top priority. Aside from developing more advanced wind turbines designs to improve the availability, an effective way to achieve this improvement is to apply reliable and cost-effective condition monitoring techniques. This paper is a general review and classification of methods and techniques for wind turbine condition monitoring. After highlighting on condition monitoring, diagnosis and maintenance theories, it outlines the relationship between these theories and related technical concepts.

AB Over the past decade the wind energy sector has grown worldwide from an installed capacity of 31.1 GW in 2002 to 273 GW in 2012. South Africa is forecasted to be one of the largest future developing markets for wind generation, particularly due to the need to introduce clean renewable energy into the generation capacity that currently consists predominantly of fossil fuel plants.
   This paper presents results of on-going research that focuses specifically on the condition monitoring of the slip ring component found in a doubly-fed induction generator, the most widely used generator topology throughout the wind energy sector. The slip ring component is maintenance intensive and that results in frequent unplanned outages and serious plant failures. Online condition monitoring of the slip ring component, especially in quantifying and trending ageing effects, has the potential to result in improved maintenance strategies and the prevention of failures.
   The approach investigated in this research involves the use of parameter estimation techniques to determine condition-related model parameters using C-code and S-function models implemented in Matlab and compiled as a Simulink library. The study aims to determine to what extent the parameters of the various subsystems can be estimated accurately enough from measurements of the terminal voltage and current waveforms to facilitate an online condition monitoring strategy. This paper presents results for one aspect of this study, namely condition monitoring of the slip ring component. Case studies are done on various theoretical-and laboratory data sets and the results of which are then compared and examined.

AB To increase wind energy production rate, there is a pressing need to improve the wind turbine availability and reduce the operational and maintenance costs. The safety and reliability of a functioning wind turbine depend largely on the protective properties of the lubrication oil for its drive train subassemblies such as gearbox and means for lubrication oil condition monitoring and degradation detection. The purpose of lubrication oil condition monitoring and degradation detection is to determine whether the oil has deteriorated to such a degree that it no longer fulfills its function. In this paper, particle contamination of lubrication oil and the remaining useful life (RUL) of the particle contaminated lubrication oil are investigated. Physical models are developed to quantify the relationship between particle contamination level and the outputs of commercially available online oil dielectric and viscosity sensors. The effectiveness of the developed models is then validated using laboratory experiments. In particular, the remaining useful life prediction of degraded lubrication oil with viscosity and dielectric constant data using particle filtering is presented. A simulation case study is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed technique.

AB Mechanical failures of wind turbines represent a significant cost in both repairs and downtime. Detecting incipient faults of wind turbine components permits maintenance to be scheduled and failed parts to be repaired or replaced before causing failures of other components or catastrophic failure of the system. This paper proposes a Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT)-based algorithm to effectively extract fault signatures in generator current signals for wind turbine fault diagnosis by using the HHT's capability of accurately representing the instantaneous amplitude and frequency of nonlinear and nonstationary signals. A phase-lock-loop (PLL) method is integrated to estimate wind turbine rotating speed, which is then used to facilitate the fault detection. The proposed method is validated by a real direct-drive wind turbine with different types of faults. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective to detect various faults in wind turbine systems as well as to reveal the severities of the faults.

AB Development of large scale offshore wind and marine current turbine farms implies to minimize and predict maintenance operations. In direct-or indirect-drive, fixed-or variable-speed turbine generators, advanced signal processing tools are required to detect and diagnose the generator faults from vibration, acoustic, or generator current signals. The induction generator is traditionally used for wind turbines power generation. Even if induction machines are highly reliable, they are subjected to many types of faults. The aim then, is to detect them at an early stage in order to prevent breakdowns and consequently ensure the continuity of power production. In this context, this paper deals with wind turbines condition monitoring using a fault detection technique based on the generator stator current. The detection algorithm uses a recursive maximum likelihood estimator to track the time-varying fault characteristic frequency and the related energy. Furthermore, a decision-making scheme and a related criterion are proposed.
   The feasibility of the proposed approach has been demonstrated using simulation data issued from coupled magnetic circuits induction generator model driven by a wind turbine for both electrical asymmetry and mechanical imbalance.

AB Distributed generation (DG) systems comprising of renewable energy generation technologies will play a significantly increasing role for future power systems. One of the key concerns for deployment of DG systems is specifically related to their availability and reliability, particularly when operating in a harsh environment. Condition monitoring (CM) can meet the requirement but has been challenged by huge amount of data to be processed especially in real time in order to reveal healthy conditions of the system. In this paper, an optimal sensor selection method based on principal component analysis (PCA) is proposed for condition monitoring of a DG system oriented to wind turbines. The proposed method is examined with both simulation data from PSCAD/EMTDC and SCADA data of an operational wind farm in the time, frequency, and time-frequency domains. The results have shown that the proposed technique could reduce the number of sensors whilst still maintaining sufficient information to assess the system's conditions.

AB A microgrid is a cluster of power generation, consumption and storage systems capable of operating either independently or as part of a macrogrid. The mechanical condition of the power production units, such as the small wind turbines, is considered of crucial importance especially in the case of islanded operation. In this paper, the fault assessment is achieved efficiently and consistently via electric signature analysis (ESA). In ESA the fault related frequency components are manifested as sidebands of the existing current and voltage time harmonics. The energy content between the fundamental, 5th and 7th harmonics (referred as residual value - RV) is measured and sent to the central microgrid controller. The controller compares RV to three predefined limits where inspection, maintenance and shut down of the turbine are the corresponding actions. The method is tested based on a finite element model where dynamic eccentricity and bearing outer race defect are simulated under varying fault severity and electric loading conditions.

AB The spectral content of the low frequency vibrations in the band from 0 to 10 Hz measured in full scale wind turbines has been statistically analyzed as a function of the whole range of steady operating conditions. Attention has been given to the amplitudes of the vibration peaks and their dependency on rotating speed and power output. Two different wind turbine models of 800 and 2000 kW have been compared. For each model, a sample of units located in the same wind farm and operating during a representative period of time have been considered. A condition monitoring system installed in each wind turbine has been used to register the axial acceleration on the gearbox casing between the intermediate and the high speed shafts. The average frequency spectrum has permitted to identify the vibration signature and the position of the first tower natural frequency in both models. The evolution of the vibration amplitudes at the rotor rotating frequency and its multiples has shown that the tower response is amplified by resonance conditions in one of the models. So, it is concluded that a continuous measurement and control of low frequency vibrations is required to protect the turbines against harmful vibrations of this nature.

AB Offshore wind is a promising energy resource to face the climate change and to reduce the gas emissions. Over the last decade, this sector has experienced a very rapid growth, wind turbines have become much powerful and wind parks became bigger. However, the costs of operations and maintenance (O&M) still represent an important part of the cost of energy (about 30 %). Structural health monitoring (SHM) can play a major role to reduce these costs, by detecting coming failures before they occur and predicting the failure time.
   On a wind turbine (WT), hundreds of sensors can be found at different location and these sensors measure, for example, temperatures, output power, rotational speed, pitch and yaw angles, etc. Their primary functions are performance optimization and load control, but they are also used for condition monitoring. Unfortunately, a high number of sensors lead to more complexity and more sensor faults. As a result, relationships, correlations and redundancies are not used enough, even sometimes not used at all, in WT SHM. Moreover, through a high number of sensors, a wind turbine may be subjected to more and more frequent short stops that are not always necessary (false alarms).
   The main goal of this research is to optimize the sensor network and to improve its use for SHM. In this framework, several steps have to be considered. First, a theoretical analysis needs to be conducted to find what the minimum information is needed to understand a WT behavior. The WT behavior varies with respect to the environmental and operational conditions. Indeed, loads, rotation speed, power output, internal temperatures, etc. depend on these conditions. Assessing the health of a WT needs then to be performed in accordance to the working state of the WT.
   In the present research, the WT working states are described and classified into six main categories ('stopped', 'starting', 'running', 'transition around rated power', 'shutdown' and 'idling'). The possible previous and following states of each state have been determined, as well as the changes expected in the main signals. It is proven that a WT working state can be determined with only six sensors.
   This analysis will be used to build a reasoning system that can estimate the current working state and detect if there is a failure among six sensors used for working state detection. This system uses (physical) relationships between sensors, redundancies in the sensor network (at a WT level and at a wind farm level), knowledge of the previous state, expected signals from the current state, etc.

AB The National Renewable Energy Laboratory presented an investigation of various wind turbine drivetrain condition monitoring (CM) techniques at the 7th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring held in 2009. The study contained in this report is a continuation of the 2009 paper and focuses on results obtained by various CM techniques from a damaged Gearbox Reliability Collaborative test gearbox. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of each technique. In order to provide the audience a relatively complete picture, a brief discussion of CM system implementation is provided first. The dynamometer test setup, along with some failure information on the damaged gearbox obtained during its disassembly, is presented next, followed by the CM results obtained during the retest of the damaged gearbox. For comparison and discussion purposes, earlier results obtained from a test gearbox under healthy condition will also be included. Finally, the paper will conclude with some observations obtained during the tests.

AB This paper presents the research activities performed on a Small Wind Turbine (SWT) test stand. A commercially available turbine was modified towards incorporation of sensors for condition monitoring to measure angular shaft position, applied torque, rotational speed and vibration acceleration. Wind data are also acquired through an anemometer. A dedicated interface was initially developed to allow automatic and remote control of the Data Acquisition System. After each session, all acquired signals are stored in a database from where can be accessed for further processing. Once the reference response of the system is characterized, typical faults or dangerous operating conditions are simulated to obtain more information on the effects of these events on the response.. In particular, order tracking is used to identify anomalous vibration level at different RPMs.

AB Vibration signal is one kind of important variables for wind turbine in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) System. With modeling and analysis of vibration signals, incipient failure of key components such as tower, drive train and rotor could be detected. In this paper, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to model the tower vibration providing a good understanding of the tower vibration dynamic characteristics and the main factors influencing these. The merits and physical interpretation of PCA are also discussed and analyzed. With SCADA of one wind turbine during April to June in 2006, PCA model for tower vibration in normal working condition was established and validated. This method monitoring the operation of the wind generator by calculating the monitoring statistic Hotelling T-2 (T-2 for short) and SPE. If T-2 and SPE statistics over confidence limit, the decision system is abnormal. We can calculate contribution rate of each variable on the main component, then get the cause of the fault. Wind generator fault data set simulation verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Key focus of this paper is the investigation of condition monitoring and fault-tolerant control in the modular multi-stage air-cored permanent magnet synchronous generator called 'C' core generator under different electrical connections. Condition monitoring and fault-tolerant control have been identified as a means of improving the reliability and availability of offshore or inaccessible renewable energy devices. As a result, two different ways of connecting modular generator stages are presented. Based on the above topologies two wind turbine models are designed in MATLAB (R)/Simulink (R) and fault-tolerance is investigated by implementing single electrical faults in one of the stages, such as single phase open circuit, diode short circuit, two phase short circuit and diode open circuit. It was found that the first topology offers fault-tolerance against the single phase open circuit fault while the second offers isolation between generator stages in all types of faults. Finally, the signal processing techniques of alpha - beta current locus, Power Spectral Density analysis and Continuous Wavelet Transformation have been implemented in order to extract detectable patterns of the electrical faults.

AB This paper presents the research activity performed on a Small Wind Turbine (SWT) test stand. Commercially available turbine was modified towards incorporation of the sensors system for condition monitoring. Installed sensors measure angular shaft position, torque applied from the wind loads, vibration accelerations and last but not least rotational speed. All gathered data are then transferred and processed in Test.Lab by means of automatic in house developed Visual Basic application which afterwards converts TDF files to text files and stores them in a desired directory. The numerical simulation is being run in parallel to installed sensors measurements and is as well controlled by the same Visual Basic application. By having actual measurements and numerical simulation results one will be able to compare those two outcomes. In particular, if the numerical model is tailored to the physical one, data comparison will allow identifying malfunctioning due to component damage or extreme working condition.

AB Operational Modal Analysis (OMA), also known as output-only modal analysis, allows identifying modal parameters only by using the response measurements of the structures in operational conditions when the input forces cannot be measured. This information can then be used to improve numerical models in order to monitor the operating and structural conditions of the system. This is a critical aspect both for condition monitoring and maintenance of large wind turbines, particularly in the off-shore sector where operation and maintenance represent a high percentage of total costs. Although OMA is widely applied, the wind turbine case still remains an open issue. Numerical aeroelastic models could be used, once they have been validated, to introduce virtual damages to the structures in order to analyze the generated data. Results from such models can then be used as baseline to monitor the operating and structural condition of the machine.

AB The aim of the present paper is to evaluate structural health monitoring (SHIM) techniques based on modal analysis for crack detection in small wind turbine blades. A finite element (FE) model calibrated to measured modal parameters will be introduced to cracks with different sizes along one edge of the blade. Changes in modal parameters from the FE model are compared with data obtained from experimental tests. These comparisons will be used to validate the FE model and subsequently discuss the usability of SHIM techniques based on modal parameters for condition monitoring of wind turbine blades.

ID DAMAGE DETECTION
AB Real-time structural health monitoring is becoming increasingly tractable on commodity wireless sensor devices and platforms. Such algorithmic implementations must be realised in as efficient a manner as possible, in terms of memory, computation, radio communications and power efficiency. This work describes an efficient, real-time, structural change detection algorithm implemented on constrained, commodity wireless sensor nodes. The algorithm, based on the Hilbert Huang transform, initially characterises the structure and reliably signals subsequent change using a hierarchical monitoring and alert infrastructure. The system operates entirely autonomously, and algorithmic parameterisations, such as sensitivity and training period duration, can be dynamically and remotely adjusted across the air interface. The system has been evaluated on two different structures which were subject to structural change during the experiments; a Single-Degree-of-Freedom discrete dynamical system, and a 5kW wind turbine blade. The system demonstrated a highly reliable capacity to promptly detect and actuate response to structural change.

DT Article
DE Maintenance; Predictive model; Reliability
AB The feasibility of maintenance processes relies on the availability of spare parts. Spare part inventory planning is capital intensive. It is based on demand forecasting, which possesses a high potential in reducing inventories. Even if condition monitoring systems are installed in technical systems, condition monitoring information is barely used to predict the failure probability of units. Therefore, an enhanced forecast model, which integrates SCADA information, has been developed. This leads to more accurate spare part demand forecasts. The approach presented in the paper is based on data mining, the proportional hazards model (PHM) and a binomial distribution. It has been validated with maintenance data of wind energy systems.

AB Fault of gearbox is one of the significant causes which lead to high cost of wind farm, so early fault prediction of gearbox is meaningful for ensuring reliable running and reducing maintenance costs. With condition monitoring data, the relation between gearbox temperature and potential faults was researched and a new method for online fault prediction of wind turbine gearbox was presented. First, the temperature prediction model for normal behavior of gearbox was built up by non-linear regression analysis. Then, a detecting function which can indicate the deviation between actual running state and prediction state of gearbox was introduced. The condition of gearbox could be monitored by comparing the real-time value of detecting function with the chosen threshold. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrated that this method could predict the abnormality of gearbox in time, and it can be applied to monitor the running condition of gearbox.

DE Wind turbine; condition monitoring; fault diagnosis; offshore
AB Wind energy conversion is the fastest-growing source of new electric generation in the world. The unforeseen damages of a component in a wind turbine have significant impact on the wind turbines, especially offshore ones. There has been a trend towards adoption of various forms of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis to know the deteriorating condition for both mechanical and electrial components, well in advance of a breakdown. This paper review the most recent advances in these areas with a special focus on offshore wind turbines. Different type of faults on offshore wind turbines are reviewed, including gearbox and bearing failures, generators failures, rotor failures and electrical failures. And then two widely-used methods(vibration analysis and oil monitoring) for predictive condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in offshore wind turbines are reviewed.

DE Condition monitoring; Automated threshold setting; Probability
   distribution; False alarms
AB A suitable setting of threshold levels has been a dilemma for engineers in a number of science and industrial fields. It is a common problem in monitoring, where deviation from a correct state needs to be detected. As the number of monitored values in modern systems reaches thousands, threshold calculations became a significant yet frequently underestimated concern. Due to a prohibitive cost of manual threshold setting, many systems generate thousands of false alarms consequent upon running on default threshold levels. In the paper, the authors illustrate a methodology for automatic threshold calculations in a large monitoring system. The paper is mainly addressed to engineers and machine monitoring systems developers, therefore selected statistical topics were treated briefly with main focus on practical solutions. Two fundamental data types are considered; namely, vibration signal measures, which can be extended to any nonnegative data, and symmetrical process values. As it is shown, these data types have significantly different probability distributions. Since real data seldom fits the Gaussian model, an investigation of several distributions and their comparison is presented. The proposed approach is validated on four datasets including process values from a gas compressor and vibration signal measures from a wind turbine. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the increase in worldwide energy demand, wind energy technology has been developed rapidly over the past years. With a fast growing of wind power installed capacity, an efficient monitoring system for wind energy conversion system (WEC) is required to ensure operational reliability, high availability of energy production and at the same time reduce operating and maintenance (O&M) costs. The state of the art methodologies for WEC condition monitoring are signal analysis, observer-based approach, neural networks, etc. In this paper, an effective and easy adaptable multivariate data-driven method for wind turbine monitoring and fault diagnosis is introduced, which consists of three parts: 1) off-line training process 2) on-line monitoring phase 3) on-line diagnosis phase. The performance of this method is validated for detection of sensor abnormalities that have occurred in real wind turbines.

AB High operations and maintenance costs for wind turbines reduce their overall cost effectiveness. One of the biggest drivers of maintenance cost is unscheduled maintenance due to unexpected failures. Continuous monitoring of wind turbine health using automated failure detection algorithms can improve turbine reliability and reduce maintenance costs by detecting failures before they reach a catastrophic stage and by eliminating unnecessary scheduled maintenance. A SCADA-based condition monitoring system uses data already collected at the wind turbine controller. It is a cost-effective way to monitor wind turbines for early warning of failures and performance issues. In this paper, we develop three tests on power curve, rotor speed curve and pitch angle curve of individual turbine. To monitor the turbine performance better in daily base, it is critical to recognize different patterns of turbine health condition by fusing all the test results. We apply particle swarm optimization algorithm to determine the fusion rules more objectively and optimally. This novel approach gains a qualitative understanding of turbine health condition to detect faults at an early stage, and also provides explanations on what has happened for detailed diagnostics.

AB In recent years Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system has been used to monitor the condition of wind turbine components. SCADA being an integral part of wind turbines comes at no extra cost and measures an array of signals. This paper proposes to use artificial neural networks (ANN) algorithm for analysis of SCADA data for condition monitoring of components.
   The first step to build an ANN model is to create the training data set. Here an automated process to decide the training data set has been presented. The approach reduces the number of samples in the training data set compared to the conventional method of hand picking the data set. Further the approach describes how the ANN model could be kept in tune with the changes in the operating conditions of the wind turbine by updating the ANN model. The fault prognosis obtained from the model can be used to optimize the maintenance scheduling activity.

AB Effective cooling is required in power generation, processing, and distribution to avoid failure that could occur during operations. As heat loads continue to increase, manufacturers of wind turbines are turning to improve the cooling system to remove high intensity heat loads from many active parts particularly in the generator part. Wind generators need an effective cooling system due to the large amount of heat that is released during power production. Many large wind turbines (more than 5MW rated power) particularly offshore wind turbines where the water is available, heat exchangers with water-air cooling system is used, in which the water is utilized to cool the hot air. This type of heat exchangers are desired, since they are more efficient and reliable than the air-air heat exchangers, which are used in small wind turbines. Because of the growing number of failures that occurred in wind turbine generators due to high generator's temperatures owing to power losses of generator, applying condition monitoring system on wind generators depending on heat transfer analysis through the heat exchangers of wind generators plays an effective function. This helps avoid failures, decrease the potential shutdowns during running, and maintain wind turbines to be protected. In this paper new methodology has been applied by considering the heat transfer and fluid mechanics analysis through a heat exchanger of wind generator, which uses water to air cooling system. Case study based on data collected from actual measurements demonstrates the adequacy of the proposed model.

AB The development and implementation of condition monitoring system become very important for wind industry with the increasing number of failures in wind turbine generators due to over temperature especially in offshore wind turbines where higher maintenance costs than onshore wind farms have to be paid due to their farthest locations. Monitoring the wind generators temperatures is significant and plays a remarkable role in an effective condition monitoring system. Moreover, they can be easily measured and recorded automatically by the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) which gives more clarification about their behavior trend. An unexpected increase in component temperature may indicate overload, poor lubrication, or possibly ineffective passive or active cooling. Many techniques are used to reliably predict generator's temperatures to avoid occurrence of failures in wind turbine generators. Multiple Linear Regression Model (MLRM) is a model that can be used to construct the normal operating model for the wind turbine generator temperature and then at each time step the model is used to predict the generator temperature by measuring the correlation between the observed values and the predicted values of criterion variables. Then standard errors of the estimate can be found. The standard error of the estimate indicates how close the actual observations fall to the predicted values on the regression line. In this paper, a new condition-monitoring method based on applying Multiple Linear Regression Model for a wind turbine generator is proposed. The technique is used to construct the normal behavior model of an electrical generator temperatures based on the historical generator temperatures data. Case study built on a data collected from actual measurements demonstrates the adequacy of the proposed model.

AB With the rapid development of wind power, wind turbine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis must match the developing rate. The growing number of wind turbine makes all kinds of condition monitoring must be achieved online. In this paper, the fault of gearbox in wind turbine is researched deeply, based on electromagnetic field theory, propose a method to measure gear box oil composition. It provides an online method to monitor the wind turbine gearbox oil. This paper analyzes the principle of the method, sets up the equivalent circuit model and makes a detailed mathematical derivation of argument, then according to the simulation in Matlab; we verify the feasibility of this method. This method can realize monitoring gearbox oil composition, the real-time status of mechanical wear can be get on line, then indirectly found that various types of early failure of the gearbox. Successfully getting such warning signals early, relative staff can be effectively guided in the equipment maintenance arrangements before serious wear and failure happen. This will reduce equipment damage, reduce the impact of downtime production, at the same time increase the average time between failures of equipment, then result in the productivity improvement.

AB The renewable energy sector is increasing in size and wind-farm technology has improved in leaps and bounds. However the concepts of Health and Usage Monitoring and remote condition monitoring seem not to have kept pace. Whilst the manufacturers offer such technology, the user or owner communities have perhaps not understood the need and have not embraced the technology which could increase maintenance efficiency and increase availability. Using an example of a failure in a gearbox after nearly 4 years of operation and which resulted in nearly 7 weeks loss of availability, the paper identifies research questions that could produce a more enlightened maintenance regime for wind-farms based on usage and remote condition monitoring.

AB During the past decades, great efforts have been undertaken to make wind power a competitive source for electrical energy. By the end of 2012, global installed wind capacity had risen to 264GW, almost a tenfold increase of the capacity in 2002. Nevertheless, the wind energy sector is still far too expensive to be profitable, especially the strong growing offshore branch. However, a significant part (about 25%) of the cost is related to operation and maintenance (O&M), in particular the failures of the main components (i.e. gearbox and drivetrain) resulting in long downtimes and hence high O&M costs. Various studies today discuss if condition monitoring systems, which allow the forecasting of failures at a very early stage, might be the cure to the problems related to the reliability of the gearbox. Rather than formulating yet another methodology to forecast upcoming failures, the aim of this paper is to identify the underlying cause of the reliability issues related to the gearbox.

AB Rapid increase in global energy requirements has resulted in considerable attention towards energy generation from the renewable energy sources. In order to meet renewable energy targets, harnessing energy from all available resources including those from urban environment is required. Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) are seen as a potential way of utilising urban energy sources. Most of the research on the wind turbines constitutes condition monitoring and performance optimisation of VAWTs under a constant velocity of air where the transient effects have not been accounted. The inconsistent behaviour of the wind may change the nature of the flow field around the VAWT which could decrease its life cycle. This study is an attempt to use Computational Fluid Dynamic's techniques to study and analyse the performance of a wind turbine under accelerating and decelerating air inlet velocity. The performance of a VAWT is monitored under an accelerated and decelerated gust of the value 1.09m/s(2) characterised by change in velocity from 4m/sec to 10m/sec. The instantaneous torque output varies significantly when a gust of air is applied to the turbine. Furthermore the torque outputs during accelerating and decelerating flows vary, highlighting the effect of transient phenomena. This abrupt change in the instantaneous torque output of the turbine may give rise to highly transient loads on the turbine's structure which may induce heavy stresses on the turbine leading to structural failure. It has been shown that CFD can be used as an effective tool to predict the performance outputs of a VAWT under varying flow conditions. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Real-time deflection monitoring of a composite wind turbine blade was accomplished using the shape estimation algorithm with modal approach and strain data from embedded fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. The finite element model of the composite wind turbine blade was created and the displacement-strain transformation (DST) matrix on the basis of the modal approach was obtained. The locations of the nine FBG strain sensors were optimized by minimizing the condition number of the displacement-strain transformation matrix. The deflection-monitoring test of the 11m span composite blade was conducted to verify the shape reconstruction algorithm and applicability of the FBG sensors in structural condition monitoring. The estimated shapes measured by embedded Bragg grating sensors are compared with the directly captured deflection shapes measured by stereo pattern recognition (SPR) cameras. The results confirm very close agreement showing the potentials of the proposed shape estimation technique using arrayed Bragg grating sensors.

DE ANFIS models; Condition monitoring; Wind turbine; SCADA data; Normal
   behavior models
AB This paper proposes a system for wind turbine condition monitoring using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Interference Systems (ANFIS). For this purpose: (1) ANFIS normal behavior models for common Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) data are developed in order to detect abnormal behavior of the captured signals and indicate component malfunctions or faults using the prediction error. 33 different standard SCADA signals are used and described, for which 45 normal behavior models are developed. The performance of these models is evaluated in terms of the prediction error standard deviations to show the applicability of ANFIS models for monitoring wind turbine SCADA signals. The computational time needed for model training is compared to Neural Network (NN) models showing the strength of ANFIS in training speed. (2) For automation of fault diagnosis Fuzzy Interference Systems (FIS) are used to analyze the prediction errors for fault patterns. The outputs are both the condition of the component and a possible root cause for the anomaly. The output is generated by the aid of rules that capture the existing expert knowledge linking observed prediction error patterns to specific faults. The work is based on continuously measured wind turbine SCADA data from 18 turbines of the 2 MW class covering a period of 30 months.
   The system proposed in this paper shows a novelty approach with regard to the usage of ANFIS models in this context and the application of the proposed procedure to a wide range of SCADA signals. The applicability of the set up ANFIS models for anomaly detection is proved by the achieved performance of the models. In combination with the FIS the prediction errors can provide information about the condition of the monitored components.
   In this paper the condition monitoring system is described. Part two will entirely focus on application examples and further efficiency evaluation of the system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

DE offshore wind turbines; jacket type substructure; system effects;
   stochastic model; reliability
AB Deeper waters and harsher environments are the main factors that make the electricity generated by offshore wind turbines (OWTs) expensive due to high costs of the substructure, operation & maintenance and installation. The key goal of development is to decrease the cost of energy (CoE). In consequence, a rational treatment of uncertainties is done in order to assess the reliability of critical details in OWTs. Limit state equations are formulated for fatigue critical details which are not influenced by wake effects generated in offshore wind farms. Furthermore, typical bi-linear S-N curves are considered for reliability verification according to international design standards of OWTs. System effects become important for each substructure with many potential fatigue hot spots. Therefore, in this paper a framework for system effects is presented. This information can be e.g. no detection of cracks in inspections or measurements from condition monitoring systems. Finally, an example is established to illustrate the practical application of this framework for jacket type wind turbine substructure considering system effects.

DE wind turbine; tower vibration; SCADA data; nonlinear state estimation
   technique (NSET); modeling; blade asymmetry
AB With appropriate vibration modeling and analysis the incipient failure of key components such as the tower, drive train and rotor of a large wind turbine can be detected. In this paper, the Nonlinear State Estimation Technique (NSET) has been applied to model turbine tower vibration to good effect, providing an understanding of the tower vibration dynamic characteristics and the main factors influencing these. The developed tower vibration model comprises two different parts: a sub-model used for below rated wind speed; and another for above rated wind speed. Supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) data from a single wind turbine collected from March to April 2006 is used in the modeling. Model validation has been subsequently undertaken and is presented. This research has demonstrated the effectiveness of the NSET approach to tower vibration; in particular its conceptual simplicity, clear physical interpretation and high accuracy. The developed and validated tower vibration model was then used to successfully detect blade angle asymmetry that is a common fault that should be remedied promptly to improve turbine performance and limit fatigue damage. The work also shows that condition monitoring is improved significantly if the information from the vibration signals is complemented by analysis of other relevant SCADA data such as power performance, wind speed, and rotor loads.

AB This paper proposed a novel wind turbine fault diagnosis method based on the local mean decomposition (LMD) technology. Wind energy is a renewable power source that produces no atmospheric pollution. The condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in wind turbine system are important in avoiding serious damage. Vibration analysis is a normal and useful technology in wind turbine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. However, the relatively slow speed of the wind turbine components set a limitation in early fault diagnosis using vibration monitoring method. The traditional time-frequency analysis techniques have some drawbacks which make them not suitable for the nonlinear, non-Gaussian signal analysis. LMD is a new iterative approach to demodulate amplitude and frequency modulated signals, which is suitable for obtaining instantaneous frequencies in wind turbine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. The experiment analysis of the wind turbine vibration signal proves the validity and availability of the new method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Previous research for detecting incipient wind turbine failures, using condition monitoring algorithms, concentrated on wind turbine Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) signals, such as power output, wind speed and bearing temperatures, using power-curve and temperature relationships. However, very little research effort has been made on wind turbine SCADA alarms. When wind turbines are operating in significantly sized wind farms, these alarm triggers are overwhelming for operators or maintainers alike because of large number occurring in a 10?min SCADA period. This paper considers these alarms originating in two large populations of modern onshore wind turbines over a period of 12?years. First, an analysis is made on where the alarms originate. Second, a methodology for prioritizing the alarms is adopted from an oil and gas industry standard to show the seriousness of the alarm data volume. Third, two methods of alarm analysis, time-sequence and probability-based, are proposed and demonstrated on the data from one of the wind turbine populations, considering pitch and converter systems with known faults. The results of this work show that alarm data require relatively little storage yet provide rich condition monitoring information. Both the time-sequence and probability-based analysis methods have the potential to rationalize and reduce alarm data, providing valuable fault detection, diagnosis and prognosis from the conditions under which the alarms are generated. These methods should be developed and integrated into an intelligent alarm handling system for wind farms, aimed at improving wind turbine reliability to reduce downtime, increase availability and leading to a well-organized maintenance schedule.

AB Renewable energy sources have a key role to play in the global energy mix as a means of reducing the impact of energy production on climate change. Wind energy is the most developed of all renewable energy technologies with more than 200 GW of globally installed capacity as of 2011. Analyses of wind farm maintenance costs show that up to 40% of the outlay is related to unexpected component failures that lead to costly unscheduled amendments. Wind farm operators are constantly looking for new technological developments in condition monitoring that can contribute to the minimisation of wind turbine maintenance expenditure. Early fault detection through condition monitoring can help prevent major breakdowns as well as significantly decrease associated costs. Moreover it enables the optimisation of maintenance schedules, reduces downtime, increases asset availability and enhances safety and operational reliability. Faults in the braking system are of particularly concern since they can result in catastrophic failure of the wind turbine. The present study investigates online condition monitoring based on voltages and currents for mechanical wind turbine brake system fault diagnosis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Operation and maintenance (OM) cost has contributed a major share in the cost of energy for wind power generation. Condition monitoring can help reduce the OM cost of wind turbine. Among the wind turbine components, the fault diagnosis of the hydraulic pitching system is investigated in this study. The hydraulic pitching system is critical for energy capture, load reduction, and aerodynamic braking. The fault detection of internal and external leakages in the hydraulic pitching system is studied in this paper. Based on the dynamic model of the hydraulic pitching system, an adaptive parameter estimation algorithm has been developed in order to identify the internal and external leakages under the time-varying load on the pitch axis. This scheme can detect and isolate individual faults in spite of their strong coupling in the hydraulic model. A scale-down setup has been developed as the hydraulic pitch emulator, with which the proposed method is verified through experiments. The pitching-axis load input is obtained from simulation of a 1.5-MW variable-speed-variable-pitch turbine model under turbulent wind profiles on the FAST (fatigue, aerodynamics, structural, and tower) software developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. With the experimental data, the leakage and leakage coefficients can be predicted via the proposed method with good performance.

DE Wind turbine performance assessment; Multi-regime modeling; Prognostics
   & health management
AB Prognostics & health management system is an integral component of any wind energy program to ensure high turbine availability and reliability. Traditional vibration-based condition monitoring practices have been proposed to be utilized with wind turbines as they have demonstrated varying degrees of success with other rotary machinery. However, high-frequency data such as vibration and acoustic emission signals, generally, are not collected and recorded due to limitations with data storage capacities. In addition, the highly dynamic operating conditions of a wind turbine pose a challenge to conventional frequency domain analysis tools. Thus, a systematic framework that utilizes multi-regime modeling approach is proposed to consider the dynamic working conditions of a wind turbine. Three methods were developed, and they were evaluated using SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) data only that have been collected from a large-scale on-shore wind turbine for 27 months. Empirical observations from the results of the three methods indicate the ability of the approach to trend and assess turbine degradation prior to known downtime occurrences.

ID SYSTEMS; FAULT; MODEL
AB This study investigates the condition monitoring of wind turbine wound rotor and doubly fed induction generators with rotor electrical asymmetries by analysis of stator current and total power spectra. The research is verified using experimental data measured on two different test rigs and numerical predictions obtained from a time-stepping electromagnetic model. A steady-state study of current and power spectra for healthy and faulty conditions is performed to identify fault-specific signal changes and consistent slip-dependent fault-indicators on both test rigs. To enable real-time fault frequency tracking, a set of concise analytical expressions, describing fault frequency variation with operating speed, were defined and validated by measurement. A variable speed study, representative of real wind turbine operations, of current and power frequency components for healthy and faulty conditions was then carried out on one test rig, which could simulate wind conditions. The current and power fault frequency tracking previously identified achieved reliable fault detection for two realistic wind turbine generator fault scenarios of differing severity. Conclusions are drawn on the relative merits of current and power signal analysis when used for wind turbine wound rotor induction machine fault detection and diagnosis.

AB Data mining algorithms and statistical methods are applied to analyze the jerk data obtained from monitoring the gearbox of a wind turbine. Two types of analyses are performed-failure component identification and monitoring vibration excitement. In failure component identification, the failed stages of the gearbox are identified in time-domain analysis and frequency-domain analysis. In the time domain, correlation coefficient and clustering analysis are applied. The fast Fourier transformation with time windows is utilized to analyze the frequency data. To monitor the vibration excitement of the gearbox in its high-speed stage, data mining algorithms and statistical quality control theory are combined to develop a monitoring model. The capability of the monitoring model to detect changes in the gearbox vibration excitement is validated by the collected data.

AB Fault detection in complex mechanical systems such as wind turbine gearboxes remains challenging, even with the recently significant advancement of sensing and signal processing technologies. As first-principle models of gearboxes capable of reflecting response details for health monitoring purpose are difficult to obtain, data-driven approaches are often adopted for fault detection, identification or classification. In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework that combines information from multiple sensors and fundamental physics of the gearbox. Time domain vibration and acoustic emission signals are collected from a gearbox dynamics testbed, where both healthy and faulty gears with different fault conditions are tested. To deal with the nonstationary nature of the wind turbine operation, a harmonic wavelet based method is utilized to extract the time-frequency features in the signals. This new framework features the employment of the tachometer readings and gear meshing relationships to develop a speed profile masking technique. The time-frequency wavelet features are highlighted by applying the mask we construct. Those highlighted features from multiple accelerometers and microphones are then fused together through a statistical weighting approach based on principal component analysis. Using the highlighted and fused features, we demonstrate that different gear faults can be effectively detected and identified. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4004438]

AB The concept of reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) is applied to the two wind-turbine models Vestas V44-600 kW and V90-2MW. The executing RCM workgroup includes an owner and operator of the analyzed wind turbines, a maintenance service provider, a provider of condition-monitoring services, and wind-turbine component supplier as well as researchers at academia. Combining the results of failure statistics and assessment of expert judgement, the analysis is focused on the most critical subsystems with respect to failure frequencies and consequences: the gearbox, the generator, the electrical system, and the hydraulic system. This study provides the most relevant functional failures, reveals their causes and underlying mechanisms, and identifies remedial measures to prevent either the failure itself or critical secondary damage. This study forms the basis for the development of quantitative models for maintenance strategy selection and optimization, but may also provide a feedback of field experience for further improvement of wind-turbine design.

   technique (NSET); residuals analysis; trend analysis; wind turbine
AB Condition monitoring can greatly reduce the maintenance cost for a wind turbine. In this paper, a new condition-monitoring method based on the nonlinear state estimate technique for a wind turbine generator is proposed. The technique is used to construct the normal behavior model of the electrical generator temperature. A new and improved memory matrix construction method is adopted to achieve better coverage of the generator's normal operational space. Generator incipient failure is indicated when the residuals between model estimates and the measured generator temperature become significant. Moving window averaging is used to detect statistically significant changes of the residual mean value and standard deviation in an effective manner; when these parameters exceed predefined thresholds, an incipient failure is flagged. Examples based on data from the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system at a wind farm located at Zhangjiakou in northern China have been used to validate the approach and examine its sensitivity to key factors that influence the performance of the approach. It is demonstrated that the technique can identify dangerous generator over temperature before damage has occurred that results in complete shutdown of the turbine.

AB Condition Monitoring (CM) can greatly reduce the maintenance cost for a wind turbine. In this paper, history data of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is analyzed to detect the incipient failure of wind turbine generator bearing. A new condition monitoring method based on the Nonlinear State Estimate Technique (NSET) is proposed. NSET is used to construct the normal behavior model of the generator bearing temperature. Detail of NSET is introduced. When the generator bearing has an incipient failure, the residuals between NSET model estimates and the measured generator bearing temperature will become significant. When the residual exceeds the predefined thresholds, an incipient failure is flagged. Analysis of a manual drift added on the historical SCADA data for a wind turbine generator bearing demonstrates the effectiveness of this new condition monitoring method.

AB The objective of this paper is to present the methodology for the application of Reliability Centered Maintenance to wind turbines. The reliability and maintenance of wind turbines is a growing area of interest. The inherent variation in the loading experienced by wind turbines presents unique problems that differ from current practice within the power generation sector. The core of these issues center on the inherent variability of the wind and the resulting loads transferred to the equipment. Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) is a useful tool that provides the means to overcome some of these difficulties. RCM is implemented through either Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) or Time-Directed Maintenance (TDM). CBM is implemented through the use of condition monitoring based on defined condition indicators established through field experience, or laboratory testing. TDM is implemented through the use of reliability failure analysis to characterize a time directed maintenance interval. This failure analysis is performed on either laboratory test specimens, or failed field components. This paper presents the methodology for applying CBM or TDM to a wind turbine as well as suggestions for scaled laboratory testing.

AB This paper presents the latest research results of a project that focuses on normal behavior models for condition monitoring of wind turbines and their components, via ordinary Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) data. In this machine learning approach Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Interference System (ANFIS) models are employed to learn the normal behavior in a training phase, where the component condition can be considered healthy. In the application phase the trained models are applied to predict the target signals, e.g. temperatures, pressures, currents, power output, etc.
   The behavior of the prediction error is used as an indicator for normal and abnormal behavior, with respect to the learned behavior. The advantage of this approach is that the prediction error is widely decoupled from the typical fluctuations of the SCADA data caused by the different turbine operational modes.
   To classify the component condition Fuzzy Interference System, (FIS) structures are used. Based on rules that are established with the prediction error behavior during faults previously experienced and generic rules, the FIS outputs the component condition (green, yellow and red). Furthermore a first diagnosis of the root cause is given. In case of fault patterns earlier unseen the generic rules allow general statements about the signal behavior which highlight the anomaly.
   Within the current research project this method is applied to 18 onshore turbines of the 2 MW class operating since April 2009. First results show that the proposed method is well suited to closely monitor a large variety of signals, identify anomalies and correctly classify the component condition. The accuracy of the normal behavior models developed is high and small signal behavior changes become recognizable. The result of the automatic analysis is given in graphical and text format. Within the paper examples of real faults are provided, showing the capabilities of the method proposed. The method can be applied both to existing and new built turbines without the need of any additional hardware installation or manufacturers input.

AB This paper summarizes the application of "synchronous sampling" technique in the digital domain to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in detection of wind turbine gear and bearing damage signatures. In this technique, only a once-per-revolution Key Phaser or a low-count Encoder signal is required. High-count synchronous sampling is achieved by re-sampling in the digital domain. Implementation and demonstration of the aforementioned techniques are illustrated in two current wind turbine field operation examples. The improvement in the accuracy and precision of damage feature extractions is demonstrated.

AB Due to the harsh environment, the maintenance of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) is very difficult and the failure rate is very high. Improving the condition monitoring technologies will be beneficial to promote the performance of OWTs. Motivated by the application advantages of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in environment monitoring, a wireless network based condition health monitoring system for OWTs is proposed, which is composed of different types of wireless sensor nodes. Sensor nodes are deployed on the key components of OWTs based on the fault feature analysis on the different components. In order to guarantee the reliabilities of information collection and communication of the sensor nodes, the principles of the deployment and communication of the sensor nodes are presented and the cluster-based distributed wireless sensor network topology is adopted to increase the efficiency of the system. An example is given to illustrate the proposed method of the condition health monitoring for OWTs.

AB By analyzing the rotor structural dynamic response of a wind turbine, this research aims to improve decision making in operation and maintenance. To illustrate the potential of this measurement technique, a horizontal axis wind turbine test-bed is used to experimentally simulate the rotor structural dynamic response to uniform flow as well as horizontal and vertical shear flow across the rotor plane. The structural dynamic characteristics of the wind turbine rotor are described in the context of modal analysis where each mode of vibration occurs at a particular frequency with a particular modal deflection shape. These deflection shapes facilitate the effectiveness with which a given aerodynamic load couples into the rotor to produce mechanical power in addition to vibrations of the rotor. Operational modal analysis is used to explore the effects of changes in the wind state on the sensitivity of condition monitoring data to two types of damages in the turbine rotor, ice accretion and blade root cracking. Additionally, the degree to which various damage mechanisms can be identified in the presence of yaw and pitch set points is analyzed It is shown that certain frequencies in the measured response using the flap, edgewise, and span directions of the wind turbine are sensitive to a change in condition of the rotor for use in detecting that type of damage. By analyzing the changes in the modal response amplitudes, the type of damage present in the rotor system can also be classified.

AB High operations and maintenance costs for wind turbines reduce their overall cost effectiveness. One of the biggest drivers of maintenance cost is unscheduled maintenance due to unexpected failures. Continuous monitoring of wind turbine health using automated failure detection algorithms can improve turbine reliability and reduce maintenance costs by detecting failures before they reach a catastrophic stage and by eliminating unnecessary scheduled maintenance. A SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System) -data based condition monitoring system uses data already collected at the wind turbine controller. It is a cost-effective way to monitor wind turbines for early warning of failures and performance issues. In this paper, we describe our exploration of existing wind turbine SCADA data for development of fault detection and diagnostic techniques for wind turbines. We used a number of measurements to develop anomaly detection algorithms and investigated classification techniques using clustering algorithms and principal components analysis for capturing fault signatures. Anomalous signatures due to a reported gearbox failure are identified from a set of original measurements including rotor speeds and produced power.

AB This paper deals with the condition monitoring of a wind turbine gearbox under varying operating conditions, which cause nonstationarity. The gearbox vibration signals are decomposed into a set of monocomponent signals using the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method. The Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator (TKEO) in combination with an energy separation method is also presented as an alternative technique that seems to improve the time-frequency analysis of signals. In this study, the TKEO is applied to the signal components who's frequency bandwidth is related to the frequencies more influenced by damage. The Teager-Kaiser energy operator is a nonlinear operator that calculates the energy of monocomponent signals as the product of the square of the amplitude and the frequency of the signal. The instantaneous characteristics of these signals are then obtained by the application of the Discrete Energy Separation Algorithm (DESA-2). It will be shown that TKEO improves the estimation of instantaneous characteristics of the vibration data compared to other commonly used techniques, e. g. the Hilbert Transform.

AB Wind turbines are good examples of time-varying systems as their modal properties depend on their instantaneous configuration. To catch the variations of modal parameters in time-varying systems, classical identification methods have to be adapted to the non-stationary nature of the recorded signals. In this paper, it is proposed to study the dynamic behavior of an offshore five-megawatt wind turbine. First, a numerical model of the wind turbine is created to serve as reference. Then, the time-varying behavior of the system is evaluated by simulating a large number of possible configurations. To this purpose, time responses are generated from the numerical model submitted to different environmental conditions. The wind is considered as the main non-measured external excitation force on the structure and the responses are recorded at several locations to simulate a real measurement process. Special care is brought to the accessibility of the measurement locations and to the limited number of available sensors in practice. Using these simulated measurements, output-only identification methods are used to extract varying dynamic properties of the structure. The final objective of this work is to pave the way to online condition monitoring of wind turbines.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB The focus of the paper is on a design of a fatigue load estimator for predictive condition monitoring systems (CMS) of wind turbines. In order to avoid high-price measurement equipment required for direct load measuring, an indirect approach is suggested using only measurements from supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. Estimated loads can be further used for prediction of remaining operating lifetime of turbine components, detection of high stress level or fault detection. An augmented Kalman filter is chosen as the fatigue load estimator because its characteristics well suit for the real time application. This paper presents results of the estimation of the gearbox fatigue load, often called shaft torque, using simulated data of wind turbine. Noise sensitivity of the algorithm is investigated by assuming different levels of measurement noise. Shaft torque estimations are compared with simulated data and as the obtained results are promising, further work will be on a validation of the method using real wind turbine data.

AB Power generation has the goal of maximizing power output while minimizing operations and maintenance cost. The challenge for plant manager is to move closer to reliability limits while being confident the risks of any decision are understood. To attain their goals and meet this challenge they are coming to realize that they must have frequent, accurate assessment of equipment operating conditions, and a path to continued innovation-. At a typical plant, making this assessment involves the collection and effective analysis of reams of complex, interrelated production system data, including demand requirements, load, ambient temperature, as well as the dependent equipment data.
   Wind turbine health and performance data is available from periodic and real-time systems. To obtain the timeliest understanding of equipment health for all the key resources in a large plant or fleet, engineers increasingly turn to real-time, model-based solutions. Real-time systems are capable of creating actionable intelligence from large amounts and diverse sources of current data. They can automatically detect problems and provide the basis for diagnosis and prioritization effectively for many problems, and they can make periodic inspection methods much more efficient. Technology exists to facilitate prediction of when assets will fail, allowing engineers to target maintenance costs more effectively. But, it is critical to select the best predictive analytics for your plant. How do you make that choice correctly?
   Real-time condition monitoring and analysis tools need to be matched to engineering process capability. Tools are employed at the plant in lean, hectic environments; others are deployed from central monitoring centers charged with concentrating scarce resources to efficiently support plants. Applications must be flexible and simple to implement and use.
   Choices made in selection of new tools can be very important to future success of plant operations. So, these choices require solid understanding of the problems to be solved and the advantages and trade-offs of potential solutions. This choice of the best Predictive Analytic solution will be discussed in terms of key technology elements and key engineering elements.

AB Condition Monitoring of bearings used in Wind Turbines (WT) is an important issue and due to wide range of the operating conditions variations should be monitored online. Due to mentioned non-stationary load/speed conditions, signal processing and decision making for bearings diagnostics is still challenging issue. As a data source a professional monitoring system is used. Two kind of information have been acquired: RMS of vibration acceleration signal and generator power that is related to the operating conditions. The received data cover the period of several months, when the bearing has changed its condition significantly. Due to considerable variability of the mentioned data, an embedded decision making regarding the condition of bearings is difficult. The novel method proposed in the paper is based on statistical feature processing instead of just simple comparison of the value of the feature with threshold that is used in the system. Statistical data processing is done in two dimensional feature-load space in several sub-ranges of operating conditions. It has been found that for different load ranges behavior of data and effectiveness of bad-good data separation ability is different. Decomposition of data in several load sub-ranges has provided better recognition efficiency than for all data taken together.

ID FAULT-DETECTION
AB Gearbox faults constitute a significant portion of all faults and downtime in wind turbines (WTs). Current-based gearbox fault diagnosis has significant advantages over traditional vibration-based techniques in terms of cost, implementation, and reliability. This paper derives a mathematical model for a WT drive train consisting of a two-stage gearbox and a permanent magnet (PM) generator, from which the characteristic frequencies of gear tooth breaks in generator stator current frequency spectra are clearly identified. A adaptive signal resampling algorithm is proposed to convert the variable fault characteristic frequencies to constant values for WTs running at variable speeds. A fault detector is proposed for diagnosis of gear tooth breaks using statistical analysis on the fault signatures extracted from the stator current spectra. Experimental results on a real gearbox are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed model and method for diagnosis of gear tooth breaks.

ID INTERROGATION
AB A fiber grating sensor system for use in condition monitoring of wind turbine blades is constructed. A rotary optical joint was used to connect the fiber grating sensors to the non-rotating signal processing unit with moderate insertion loss. The Bragg wavelengths were interrogated by a spectrometer demodulator which consisted of a volume phase grating and a 512-pixel photo-detector array. Using the constructed sensor system, various strain/temperature measuring experiments have been performed. We applied fiber grating sensors at different locations on the wind turbine blade. Different types of strain, stroke, and temperature variations were applied to the sensors and the results were analyzed according to the sensor locations and the blade's rotary speed.

ID SPECTRAL KURTOSIS; DIAGNOSTICS
AB Wind turbines are nowadays one of the most promising energy sources. Every year, the amount of energy produced from the wind grows steadily. Investors demand turbine manufacturers to produce bigger, more efficient and robust units. These requirements resulted in fast development of condition-monitoring methods. However, significant sizes and varying operational conditions can make diagnostics of the wind turbines very challenging.
   The paper shows the case study of a wind turbine that had suffered a serious rolling element bearing (REB) fault. The authors compare several methods for early detection of symptoms of the failure. The paper compares standard methods based on spectral analysis and a number of novel methods based on narrowband envelope analysis, kurtosis and cyclostationarity approach.
   The very important problem of proper configuration of the methods is addressed as well. It is well known that every method requires setting of several parameters. In the industrial practice, configuration should be as standard and simple as possible. The paper discusses configuration parameters of investigated methods and their sensitivity to configuration uncertainties.

AB The paper develops a simplified two-degree-of-freedom gear model that simulates vibration signals under operational conditions similar to those of wind turbine gearboxes. Nonlinear characteristics were included in the model in order to obtain more realistic results. The two types of faults examined in this study are common periodic gear tooth faults and intermittent gear tooth faults. The latter type of faults appears to be a novel idea in the condition monitoring field. Transient loads are also taken into consideration in this study since such loads are commonly observed in wind turbine systems, and make it even more difficult to detect damage. The analysis of the obtained signals is done using a relatively new method, the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) that works well for nonstationary and nonlinear signals.

AB New generations of offshore wind turbines are playing a leading role in the energy arena. One of the target challenges is to achieve reliable Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of the blades. Fault detection at the early stage is a vital issue for the structural and economical success of the large wind turbines. In this study, experimental measurements of Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) are used and identification of mode shapes and natural frequencies is accomplished via an LMS system. Novelty detection is introduced as a robust statistical method for low-level damage detection which has not yet been widely used in SHM of composite blades. Fault diagnosis of wind turbine blades is a challenge due to their composite material, dimensions, aerodynamic nature and environmental conditions. The novelty approach combined with vibration measurements introduces an online condition monitoring method. This paper presents the outcomes of a scheme for damage detection of carbon fibre material in which novelty detection approaches are applied to FRF measurements. The approach is demonstrated for a stiffened composite plate subject to incremental levels of impact damage.

AB Condition Monitoring of bearings used in Wind Turbines (WT) is an important issue. In general, bearings diagnostics is well-recognized field; however it is not the case for machines working under non-stationary load. An additional difficulty is that the Main Bearing (MB) discussed here, it is used to support low speed shaft, so dynamic response of MB is not clear as for a high-speed shaft. In the case of varying load/speed a vibration signal acquired from bearings is affected by operation and makes the diagnosis difficult. These difficulties come from the variation of diagnostic features caused mostly by load/speed variation, low energy of sought features and high noise levels. In the paper a novel diagnostic approach is proposed for main rotor bearings used in wind turbines. From a commercial diagnostic system two kind of information have been acquired: peak-to-peak vibration acceleration and generator power that is related to the operating conditions. The received data cover the period of several months, when the bearing has been replaced due to its failure and the new one has been installed. Due to serious variability of the mentioned data, a decision-making regarding the condition of bearings is pretty difficult. Application of classical statistical pattern recognition for data from the period A (bad condition) and the period B (after replacement, good condition) is not sufficient because the probability density functions of features overlap each other (pdf of peak-to-peak feature for bad and good conditions). Proposed approach is based on an idea proposed earlier for planetary gearboxes, i.e. to analyse data for bad/good conditions in two-dimensional space, feature - load. It is shown that the final data presentation is a good basis to the very successful classification of data (i.e. recognition of damaged and undamaged bearings).

AB Along with the rapid economic development, the large power-generating wind energy conversion systems are increasing both in number and in size. Because of the high construction cost, the consequence of any structural failure, especially offshore where replacing a damaged member such as blade which weights tones, is pretty expensive. Consequently particular actions are required to the protection of these structures. Among these many strategies, continuously monitoring of the condition of the system which provides a predication long before the actual failure should be one of the most efficient ways. In the paper, the main problems and their corresponding surveillance schemes of the system including tower, foundation, blade and turbine nacelle are discussed.

AB In this paper, a remote condition monitoring system is proposed, which fundamentally consists of real-time monitoring modules on the plant side, a remote support centre and the communications between them. The paper addresses some of the key issues related on the monitoring system, including i) the implementation and configuration of a VPN connection, ii) an effective database system to be able to handle huge amount of monitoring data, and iii) efficient data mining techniques to convert raw data into useful information for plant assessment. The preliminary results have demonstrated that the proposed system is practically feasible and can be deployed to monitor the emerging new energy generation systems.

AB Minimum Entropy Deconvolution (MED) has been recently introduced to the machine condition monitoring field to enhance fault detection in rolling element bearings and gears. MED proved to be an excellent aid to the extraction of these impulses and diagnosing their origin, i.e. the defective component of the bearing. In this paper, MED is revisited and re-introduced with further insights into its application to fault detection and diagnosis in rolling element bearings. The MED parameter selection as well as its combination with pre-whitening is discussed. Two main cases are presented to illustrate the benefits of the MED technique. The first one was taken from a fan bladed test rig. The second case was taken from a wind turbine with an inner race fault. The usage of the MED technique has shown a strong enhancement for both fault detection and diagnosis. The paper contributes to the knowledge of fault detection of rolling element bearings through providing an insight into the usage of MED in rolling element bearings diagnostic. This provides a guide for the user to select optimum parameters for the MED filter and illustrates these on new interesting cases both from a lab environment and an actual case.

AB Maintaining a wind turbine and ensuring secure is not easy because of long-term exposure to the environment and high installation locations. Wind turbines need fully functional condition-monitoring and fault diagnosis systems that prevent accidents and reduce maintenance costs. This paper presents a simulator design for fault diagnosis of wind power systems and further proposes some fault diagnosis technologies such as signal analysis, feature selecting, and diagnosis methods. First, this paper uses a wind power simulator to produce fault conditions and features from the monitoring sensors. Then an extension neural network type-1- (ENN-1-) based method is proposed to develop the core of the fault diagnosis system. The proposed system will benefit the development of real fault diagnosis systems with testing models that demonstrate satisfactory results.

AB The proportion of worldwide installed wind power in power systems increases over the years as a result of the steadily growing interest in renewable energy sources. Still, the advantages offered by the use of wind power are overshadowed by the high operational and maintenance costs, resulting in the low competitiveness of wind power in the energy market. In order to reduce the costs of corrective maintenance, the application of condition monitoring to gearboxes becomes highly important, since gearboxes are among the wind turbine components with the most frequent failure observations. While condition monitoring of gearboxes in general is common practice, with various methods having been developed over the last few decades, wind turbine gearbox condition monitoring faces a major challenge: the detection of faults under the time-varying load conditions prevailing in wind turbine systems. Classical time and frequency domain methods fail to detect faults under variable load conditions, due to the temporary effect that these faults have on vibration signals. This paper uses the statistical discipline of outlier analysis for the damage detection of gearbox tooth faults. A simplified two-degree-of-freedom gearbox model considering nonlinear backlash, time-periodic mesh stiffness and static transmission error, simulates the vibration signals to be analysed. Local stiffness reduction is used for the simulation of tooth faults and statistical processes determine the existence of intermittencies. The lowest level of fault detection, the threshold value, is considered and the Mahalanobis squared-distance is calculated for the novelty detection problem.

AB The structure of a wind turbine blade plays a vital role in the mechanical and structural operation of the turbine. As new generations of offshore wind turbines are trying to achieve a leading role in the energy market, key challenges such as a reliable Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of the blades is significant for the economic and structural efficiency of the wind energy. Fault diagnosis of wind turbine blades is a "grand challenge" due to their composite nature, weight and length. The damage detection procedure involves additional difficulties focused on aerodynamic loads, environmental conditions and gravitational loads. It will be shown that vibration dynamic response data combined with AANNs is a robust and powerful tool, offering on-line and real time damage prediction. In this study the features used for SHM are Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) acquired via experimental methods based on an LMS system by which identification of mode shapes and natural frequencies is accomplished. The methods used are statistical outlier analysis which allows a diagnosis of deviation from normality and an Auto-Associative Neural Network (AANN). Both of these techniques are trained by adopting the FRF data for normal and damage condition. The AANN is a method which has not yet been widely used in the condition monitoring of composite materials of blades.

AB In this paper, we present a prognosis architecture that allows the computation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a failing process. A process subject to an incipient fault experiments slowly developing degradation. Sensor measurements and Condition Monitoring (CM) data extracted from the system allow to follow up the process drift. The prognosis architecture we propose makes use of a dynamical clustering algorithm to model the data in a feature space. This algorithm uses a sliding window scheme on which the model is iteratively updated. Metrics applied on the parameters of this model are used to compute a drift severity indicator, which is also an indicator of the health of the system. The architecture for prognosis is applied on a benchmark of wind turbine. The used benchmark has been constructed to serve as a realistic wind turbine model. It was used in the context of a global scale fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control competition. The benchmark also proposed a drifting fault scenario that we used to test our approach.

AB Wind energy's contribution to electricity supply is significantly increasing. As a result, reliability of the wind turbine becomes crucial. Gearbox is known as one of the most critical subassemblies of the wind turbine in which failures could lead to a long-term and high cost downtime. Recently, electrical signature analysis has been considered as an alternative for vibration monitoring in order to detect both electrical and mechanical faults in a cheap, easy to install and accessible way. This paper aims to monitor the planetary gearbox effect of a wind turbine on the wound rotor induction generator using electrical signature. For that, dynamic model of a single stage planetary gearbox have been implemented. The proposed model includes essential non-linearities such as time varying mesh stiffness, transmission error and damping force. Simulation results clearly show that electromagnetic torque and stator current of generator contain mesh and rotating related frequencies of the gears in its spectra.

AB Wind energy is currently the fastest growing source of renewable energy used for electrical generation around world. Wind farms are adding a significant amount of electrical generation capacity. The increase in the number of wind farms has led to the need for more effective operation and maintenance procedures. Condition Monitoring System(CMS) can be used to aid plant owners in achieving these goals. Its aim is to provide operators with information regarding the health of their machines, which in turn, can help them improve operational efficiency. In this work, wind turbine fault detection system based on wind vs. power performance curve obtained from SCADA is studied. Considered fault detection scheme utilizes artificial neural network for training normal behavior of wind turbine system. Furthermore, In order to verify the effectiveness of the performance curve based fault detection scheme, SCADA data obtained from 850kW wind turbine system installed in Kunsan Korea are used and various simulation studies were carried out.

TI Wind Turbine Condition Assessment Through Power Curve Copula Modeling
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Energy conversion; power generation reliability; wind power generation
ID RELIABILITY
AB Power curves constructed from wind speed and active power output measurements provide an established method of analyzing wind turbine performance. In this paper, it is proposed that operational data from wind turbines are used to estimate bivariate probability distribution functions representing the power curve of existing turbines so that deviations from expected behavior can be detected. Owing to the complex form of dependency between active power and wind speed, which no classical parameterized distribution can approximate, the application of empirical copulas is proposed; the statistical theory of copulas allows the distribution form of marginal distributions of wind speed and power to be expressed separately from information about the dependency between them. Copula analysis is discussed in terms of its likely usefulness in wind turbine condition monitoring, particularly in early recognition of incipient faults such as blade degradation, yaw, and pitch errors.

AB Purpose - Bearings in field applications with high dynamic loading, e.g. wind energy plants, suffer from sudden failure initiated by subsurface material transformation, known as white etching cracks in a typical scale of mu m, preferably around the maximum Hertzian stress zone. Despite many investigations in this field no precise knowledge about the root cause of those failures is available, due to the fact that failure under real service conditions of wind energy plants differs from what is known from test rig results in terms of contact loading, lubrication or dynamics. The purpose of this paper is to apply Barkhausen noise measurement to a full bearing test ring running under conditions of elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EH L) with high radial preload.
   Design/methodology/approach - Full bearing tests are carried out by use of DGBB (Deep Grove Ball Bearings) with 6206 specification, material set constant as 100Cr6, martensitic hardening, 10-12 percent maximum retained austenite and radial preload of 3500 MPa. Speed is set 9000 rpm, temperature is self setting at 80 degrees C by test conditions. For tests, synthetic hydrocarbon base oil (Poly-alpha-Olefine) with a 1 percent amount of molydenumdithiophosphate (organic chain given as 2-ethylhexyl) was used.
   Findings - Non-destructive fractal dimension analyses by use of Barkhausen noise measurements is of versatile value in terms of recording bearing manufacturing processes, but can also be part of non-destructive condition monitoring of bearings in field applications, where predictive reactive maintenance is crucial for availability of the plant.
   Research limitations/implications - Barkhausen noise signal recording may also be valuable for case studies related to microstructure changes of steel under operation conditions. Bearings are exposed in plenty of conditions to phenomena such as straying currents, subsequently straying magnetic fields. Hardly anything is known about how microstructure of bearing steel is susceptible to such conditions. This will be part of further studies.
   Originality/value - Results given in the paper show that sudden bearing failure, according to formation of subsurface material property changes might be driven by activities of dislocations. Since those activities start with sequences of stress field-induced formation of domains, later by formation of low-angle subgrains, and at least phase transformation, recording of the Barkhausen signal would lead to real predictive condition monitoring in applications where a highly dynamic loading of the contact, even with low nominal contact pressure leads to sudden failure induced by white etching.

AB Condition monitoring measurements can be obtained from wind turbine components and be utilized to evaluate and predict the health conditions of the components and the turbines, and for scheduling condition based maintenance (CBM) activities. In existing work, all the wind turbines are assumed to be of the same type, and the lead times of different components are assumed to be constant. This is not the case in many practical applications. In this paper, we develop a CBM approach for wind turbine systems considering different types of wind turbines in a wind farm, and different lead times for different components, which lead to more accurate modeling of CBM activities in actual wind farms. In the proposed CBM approach, we present a new CBM policy involving two design variables for each turbine type, a method for turbine failure probability evaluation considering different lead times, and a CBM cost evaluation method. Numerical examples demonstrate the proposed CBM approach.

AB With the fast growth in wind energy technologies, research into the condition monitoring system for wind turbines has drawn more attentions. Despite the advantages from the condition monitoring systems, there are also several challenges for the application of condition monitoring system for wind turbines. Accurate and adequate information of the wind turbine is needed for the condition monitoring system to carry out analysis, particularly with the growing size of wind farms. Another challenge is the huge amount of data needing to be collected, handled and processed. Minimising the number of sensors whilst still maintaining a sufficient number to assess the system's conditions is a critical concern for condition monitoring. This paper focuses on the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the optimization of sensor selection for wind turbine condition monitoring. The principle behind the proposed methodology is presented and the method is also validated using simulation data obtained from wind power generation model in PSCAD/EMTDC.

AB Motivation: Condition monitoring and diagnostic practices have become significantly important part of offshore wind farms in order to cut down operation and maintenance costs. The challenge is to enable Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) strategy to be implemented to provide maintenance decisions and services at the right time i.e. maintenance is performed when it is needed and not too early and in vain and not too late i.e. causing breakdown and downtime. CBM implementation is challenging due to the complexity and scalability of remote sensing, data acquisition, data manipulation, state detection, health and prognostic assessment and advisory generation.
   Objective: The paper describes the condition monitoring and prognostic challenge from both academic and industrial perspectives and presents their requirements in order to enable them to cope with multiple and complex fault and failure mode types and provide cost-effective monitoring and prognostic techniques.
   Method: The paper utilises needs gathering techniques (i.e. interviews, reports, etc.) and a developed requirements analysis framework in order to provide traceable and high quality research and development requirements.
   Result: The state of the art of Predictive Health Monitoring (PHM), industrial stakeholders' requirements for CBM strategy and requirement analysis framework for better traceability and high quality elicitation process.
   Implication: The requirement elicitation process is importantly required for current offshore wind farms due to advanced technological development, rapid scaling up of systems, and harsher installation sites in order to achieve a successful CBM strategy and higher level of cost effectiveness than exists today.

AB Condition Monitoring (CM) of wind turbines can greatly reduce the maintenance costs for wind farms, especially for offshore wind farms. A new condition monitoring method for a wind turbine gearbox using temperature trend analysis is proposed. Autoassociative Kernel Regression (AAKR) is used to construct the normal behavior model of the gearbox temperature. With a proper construction of the memory matrix, the AAKR model can cover the normal working space for the gearbox. When the gearbox has an incipient failure, the residuals between AAKR model estimates and the measurement temperature will become significant. A moving window statistical method is used to detect the changes of the residual mean value and standard deviation in a timely manner. When one of these parameters exceeds predefined thresholds, an incipient failure is flagged. In order to simulate the gearbox fault, manual temperature drift is added to the initial Supervisory Control and Data Acquisitions (SCADA) data. Analysis of simulated gearbox failures shows that the new condition monitoring method is effective.

SO WIND ENERGY
LA English

DE wind turbine; condition monitoring; wavelets; yaw; shutdown; vibration
AB Structural health monitoring (SHM) is a process of implementing a damage detection strategy for a mechanical system. Wind turbine machinery stands to benefit from SHM significantly as the ability to detect early stages of damage before significant malfunction or structural failure occurs would reduce costs of wind power projects by reducing maintenance costs. Vibration analysis of dynamic structural response is an approach to SHM that has been successfully applied to mechanical and civil systems and shows some promise for wind turbine application. Traditionally, a setback to turbine vibration-based SHM techniques has been the unavailability of turbine vibration response data. This study begins to address this issue by presenting vibration response for a commercial 2.3 MW turbine to a limited number of operating conditions. A database of acquired vibration response signals detailing turbine response to yaw motion, start-up, operation and shutdown has been assembled. A Daubechies sixth-order wavelet was used to perform an eight-level discrete wavelet decomposition such that general trends and patterns within the signals could be identified. With further development, the presented analysis of vibration response may be integrated into routines to reduce downtime and failure frequency of utility scale wind turbines.

AB The main driver behind developing advanced condition monitoring (CM) systems for the wind energy industry is the delivery of improved asset management regarding the operation and maintenance of the gearbox and other wind turbine components and systems. Current gearbox CM systems mainly detect faults by identifying ferrous materials, water, and air within oil by changes in certain properties such as electrical fields. In order to detect oil degradation and identify particles, more advanced devices are required to allow a better maintenance regime to be established. Current technologies available specifically for this purpose include Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and ferrography. There are also several technologies that have not yet been or have been recently applied to CM problems. After reviewing the current state of the art, it is recommended that a combination of sensors would be used that analyze different characteristics of the oil. The information individually would not be highly accurate but combined it is fully expected that greater accuracy can be obtained. The technologies that are suitable in terms of cost, size, accuracy, and development are online ferrography, selective fluorescence spectroscopy, scattering measurements, FTIR, photoacoustic spectroscopy, and solid state viscometers.

AB Renewable energy sources will come at the beginning of the future energy resources. In particular, wind power is among the most discussed sources in Turkey and all over the world. In this study, a model of the three-blade horizontal-axis wind turbine was designed. Analysis of fault, which may occur as a result of a possible blade deformation, was performed with the model. Comparison is provided between generator rotor speeds and torques for the states of healthy and damaged blades. Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) approach was adopted as the analysis method. The state of the healthy blade and the broken one were clearly identified by means of the CWT.

TI A novel baseline model-based technique for condition monitoring of wind
   turbine components
SO INSIGHT
LA English
DT Article
ID DIAGNOSIS
AB The operating conditions of wind turbine components have been monitored by fitting acoustic emission (AE) and vibration sensors inside wind turbines and analysing sensor measurements using appropriate signal processing techniques. However, there is still no systematic approach which can take the operating parameters of wind turbines into account when analysing the sensor measurements for condition monitoring purposes. The operating parameters of wind turbines, such as, for example, wind speed, wind direction and turbine power output etc, often have a significant effect on the measured AE and vibration signals. Therefore, there is a need to develop an effective technique which can systematically consider the effect of these wind turbine operating parameters on the features of measured AE and/or vibration signals. Consequently, any changes in the signal features which are literally produced by an abnormality of the turbine components and/or system can be correctly identified.
   Motivated by this objective, in the present study we propose a novel baseline model-based technique for condition monitoring of wind turbine components. The idea is to establish a baseline model for an operating wind turbine which represents the relationship between the wind speed, turbine power output, turbine operating parameters and the appropriate features of correspondingly measured vibration and/or AE signals. Given a specific working condition, the model output can be regarded as the baseline features of measured AE and/or vibration signals. Therefore, any significant deviation of practically measured AE and vibration signal features from the baseline can be explained to be due to some kind of abnormality inside the turbine components and/or system. Consequently, the information can be effectively used to achieve the objective of condition monitoring and even fault diagnosis.
   The application of the proposed method to the real AE, vibration and turbine operating parameter (wind speed and power output) data collected from an operating wind turbine is described in the paper. The results verify the effectiveness of the new approach and demonstrate its potential to address complicated offshore wind turbine condition monitoring problems.

SO JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION

ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS
AB Accessing difficulties and harsh environments require more advanced condition monitoring techniques to ensure the high availability of offshore wind turbines. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has been shown to be a promising technique for meeting this need. However, EMD was developed for one-dimensional signals, unable to carry out an information fusion function which is of importance to reach a reliable condition monitoring conclusion. Therefore, bivariate empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) is investigated in this paper to assess whether it could be a better solution for wind turbine condition monitoring. The effectiveness of the proposed technique in detecting machine incipient fault is compared with EMD and a recently developed wavelet-based 'energy tracking' technique. Experiments have shown that the proposed BEMD-based technique is more convenient than EMD for processing shaft vibration signals, and more powerful than EMD and wavelet-based techniques in terms of processing the non-stationary and nonlinear wind turbine condition monitoring signals and detecting incipient mechanical and electrical faults.

In the first part, with the aid of a dynamical model of the wind turbine system, a so-called H-infinity/H- observer in the finite frequency range, is applied to generate the residual for fault detection. The observer is designed to be sensitive to faults but insensitive to disturbances, such as wind turbulence. When there is a detectable fault, the observer sends an alarm signal if the residual evaluation is larger than a predefined threshold. In addition to the fault detection, we also consider the fault estimation problem, where a dynamic filter is used to estimate the fault magnitude. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by simulation results for several fault scenarios. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB By utilizing condition monitoring information collected from wind turbine components, condition based maintenance (CBM) strategy can be used to reduce the operation and maintenance costs of wind power generation systems. The existing CBM methods for wind power generation systems deal with wind turbine components separately, that is, maintenance decisions are made on individual components, rather than the whole system. However, a wind farm generally consists of multiple wind turbines, and each wind turbine has multiple components including main bearing, gearbox, generator, etc. There are economic dependencies among wind turbines and their components. That is, once a maintenance team is sent to the wind farm, it may be more economical to take the opportunity to maintain multiple turbines, and when a turbine is stopped for maintenance, it may be more cost-effective to simultaneously replace multiple components which show relatively high risks. In this paper, we develop an optimal CBM solution to the above-mentioned issues. The proposed maintenance policy is defined by two failure probability threshold values at the wind turbine level. Based on the condition monitoring and prognostics information, the failure probability values at the component and the turbine levels can be calculated, and the optimal CBM decisions can be made accordingly. A simulation method is developed to evaluate the cost of the CBM policy. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed CBM approach. A comparative study based on commonly used constant-interval maintenance policy demonstrates the advantage of the proposed CBM approach in reducing the maintenance cost. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The condition monitoring measurements that can be obtained from wind turbine components include vibration data, acoustic emission data, oil analysis data, power voltage and current data, etc. The objective of condition based maintenance (CBM) is to optimize the maintenance activities based on the prognostics information to minimize the overall costs of wind power generation systems. In this paper, we develop a CBM approach for wind turbine systems considering the economic dependency of different wind turbine types. The proposed CBM policy is defined by failure probability threshold values at the wind turbine level. For each turbine type, two threshold values are defined. After failure probability values at the component level over the lead times, and at the turbine level, are calculated, decisions can be made on whether a maintenance team should be sent to the wind farm, which turbines should be maintained and which components should be maintained. Models are also developed to evaluate the cost for a certain CBM policy.

AB There is a constant need for the reduction of operational and maintenance costs of Wind Energy Conversion System(WECS). The most efficient way of reducing these costs would be to continuously monitor the condition of these systems, which allows for early detection of the degeneration of the generator health, facilitating a proactive response, minimizing downtime, and maximizing productivity. Wind generators are also inaccessible since they are situated on extremely high towers. There are also plans to increase the number of offshore sites increasing the need for a remote means of WECS monitoring that overcomes some of the difficulties of accessibility problems. Therefore it is important of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in WECS. The monitoring schemes of transfer its monitor status with JESS technology was put forward in this paper. A remote condition monitoring platform (RCMP) was designed and constructed in this project. And its result brings us an effective solution to deal with the WECS condition monitoring.

AB As the share of wind energy increases on the global energy market, the efficient operation of wind farms gains an ever growing significance. Among operational decisions, the planning and scheduling of maintenance operations are crucial for the availability of turbines, as well as for the operational costs. The paper introduces a system that performs the detailed scheduling of maintenance operations at a set of wind farms maintained by common personnel. The scheduling problem is modeled and solved as a mixed-integer linear program. The system constitutes a module of an integrated framework for condition monitoring, diagnosis, and maintenance of wind turbines. (C) 2011 CIRP.

AB This paper will study condition monitoring signals of a distributed generation (DG) system not only due to the mechanical and electrical faults inside the wind turbines but also due to the grid system fluctuations. A novel feature extraction and characterisation method based on singularity detection of the monitoring data will be presented, aiming to identify the abnormal events and fault conditions as early as possible. The algorithm used to calculate Lipschitz values is given in the paper and efficient processing and storage of monitoring data is also discussed. The preliminary research has produced promising results.

AB Condition Monitoring (CM) can greatly reduce the maintenance cost for a Wind Energy Converter (WEC). In this paper, history data of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is analyzed to detect the incipient failure of WEC generator bearing. A new condition monitoring method based on the Nonlinear State Estimate Technique (NSET) is proposed. NSET is used to construct the normal behavior model of the generator bearing temperature. When the generator bearing has an incipient failure, the residuals between NSET model estimates and the measured generator bearing temperature will become significant. When the residual exceeds the predefined thresholds, an incipient failure is flagged. Analysis of a manual drift added on the historical SCADA data for a WEC generator bearing demonstrates the effectiveness of this new condition monitoring method.

AB Bearing is the most frequently used component in a wind turbine, and its' faults would lead to completely stall of a machine. Therefore, bearing Fault Diagnosis is an important part of condition monitoring in a wind turbine. This paper presented a High Frequency Resonance (HFR) method to implement bearing fault detection and fault diagnosis. This technique extracted the amplitude and frequency modulations of the vibration signals which measured from a wind turbine system. For the amplitude demodulation is inherent in the vibration signals, the fault frequency will be detected from the spectrum of the transformed original signals. And the effectiveness of this approach has been validated by simulated signal and experimental data.

AB Wind energy is one of the fastest growing sources of renewable energy in Europe as well as on a global scale. In order to increase the competitiveness of wind power against other competing energy sources there is a profound need to optimise the operational and maintenance costs of wind turbines. The most efficient way of reducing these costs is through an evolution to predictive maintenance procedures based on condition monitoring of key turbine components. Condition monitoring allows early detection of degradation of the actual health of various components such as the gearbox, brake system, blade, tower, etc., facilitating a proactive response, minimising downtime, and maximising the overall annual capacity of wind farms. Due to the importance of condition monitoring for the wind energy industry and the need for future research, a substantial amount of research has been carried out in the field of wind turbine condition monitoring. This paper summarises this state of the art, describing different maintenance models, condition monitoring techniques and algorithms, and highlights the importance of the NIMO's system integrated concept. A qualitative evaluation using fault tree analysis has also been carried out to identify future research opportunities for fault diagnostics.

DE Acoustic Emission; Wind turbine blades; On-line monitoring
AB Wind turbine blades are among the most exposed parts of a wind turbine since, due to the nature of the wind, they are subject to aerodynamic loads with great variability, strong gusts of wind, and occasionally sustain severe weather conditions while rotating. Furthermore, the structural integrity of the composite material blades is critical to the entire wind turbine for safety reasons and also for increased efficiency. However, inspection of installed blades during operation, or even during off-line mode presents practical difficulties such as accessibility, nature of the material, size of the blades, complicated geometry, etc.
   Acoustic Emission (AE) has been proven highly effective in detecting and identifying damage in wind turbine blades and generally composites under load through numerous laboratory tests including full-scale blade tests. However, in-service monitoring experience of wind turbine blades is limited. Within the scopes of a European-funded research project (NIMO), which aims to develop a novel, integrated condition monitoring system for wind turbines, a module was developed and installed on a wind turbine for structural health monitoring of the rotor blades during operation.
   In the present paper, a brief description of the developed module is provided, as well as the difficulties that had to be overcome during the installation of the system. AE data acquired during the first trials of the system is presented, along with advanced data analysis through pattern recognition and neural networks software.
   The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2009-2013) under grant agreement no 239462.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB The operating conditions of wind turbine components have been monitored by fitting acoustic emission (AE) and vibration sensors inside wind turbines and analysing sensor measurements using appropriate signal processing techniques. However, there is still no systematic approach which can take the operating parameters of wind turbines into account when analysing the sensor measurements for condition monitoring purposes. The operating parameters of wind turbines such as, for example, wind speed, wind direction and turbine power output, etc. often have a significant effect on the measured AE and vibration signals. Therefore there is a need to develop an effective technique which can systematically consider the effect of these wind turbine operating parameters on the features of measured AE and/or vibration signals. Consequently, any change in the signal features which are literally produced by abnormality of turbine components and/or system can be correctly identified.
   Motivated by this objective, in the present study, we propose a novel baseline model based technique for condition monitoring of wind turbine components. The idea is to establish a baseline model for an operating wind turbine which represents the relationship between the wind speed, turbine power output, etc. turbine operating parameters and the appropriate features of correspondingly measured vibration and/or AE signals. Given a specific working condition, the model output can be regarded as the baseline features of measured AE and/or vibration signals. Therefore, any significant deviation of practically measured AE and vibration signal features from the baseline can be explained to be due to some kind of abnormality inside turbine components and/or system. Consequently, the information can be effectively used to achieve the objective of condition monitoring, even fault diagnosis.
   The application of the proposed method to the real AE, vibration and turbine operating parameter (wind speed and power output) data collected from an operating wind turbine is described in the paper. The results verify the effectiveness of the new approach and demonstrate its potential to address complicated offshore wind turbine condition monitoring problems.

AB This paper presents the role of SeeBytes RECOVERY system within the wind energy industry, with specific focus on an offshore scenario. The current generation of condition monitoring systems (CMS) in relation to wind energy are generally provided by turbine manufacturers, or have been adapted from other industries. These systems have a propensity to focus explicitly on individual parts of the turbine (e.g. gearbox and bearings), therefore they are limited in monitoring scope and do not benefit from a system-wide view allowing an understanding of cause and effect across all parts of the turbine. This poor overview of the turbine system means that systems available today are seen as being prone to false alarms which lead to incorrect diagnosis (e.g. incorrect recognition of a sensor failure or of the cause of a vibration) and unnecessary intervention, the cry wolf syndrome, where ultimately important warnings are ignored. In addition, this approach could lead to costly incorrect diagnoses.
   To fully realise the potential of condition monitoring and its impact on decision making/maintenance scheduling, RECOVERY, as a holistic condition monitoring system, is able to monitor the entire wind turbine in an integrated manner. This proposed holistic system takes a broad view of events and sensor values across the complete turbine system and subsystems (also across a complete farm) to improve diagnostic correctness and reduce no-fault-found situations. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the capability of RECOVERY to fuse data from multiple sources, increasing the ability to predict failures event, and reducing the number of false alarms.

AB Condition Monitoring of bearings used in machines working under non-stationary load is an important issue. The varying load affects a vibration signal acquired from bearings and makes the diagnosis difficult. These difficulties come from the variation of diagnostic features caused mostly by load variation. In the paper a novel diagnostic approach is proposed for main rotor bearings used in wind turbines. From a commercial diagnostic system two kind of information have been acquired: peak-to-peak vibration acceleration and generator power that is related to the operating conditions. The received data cover the period of several months, when the bearing has been replaced due to its failure and the new one has been installed. Due to serious variation of the mentioned data, a decision making regarding the condition of bearings is very difficult. Application of a classical statistical pattern recognition for data from the period A (bad condition) and the period B (after replacement, good condition) is not sufficient due to probability density functions of features overlapping (pdf of peak-to-peak feature for bad and good conditions). Proposed approach based on an idea proposed earlier for planetary gearboxes, i.e. to analyse data for bad/good conditions in two dimensional space, feature - load is presented. Using the proposed procedure, it has been decided to reject some data for smallest and highest load conditions. It is shown that the final data presentation is a good basis to the very successful classification of data (i.e. recognition of damaged and undamaged bearings).

AB Metallic wear debris sensors using inductive sensing technologies are available commercially from several manufacturers and are ideally suited to online condition monitoring of the lubricating oil in wind turbine gearsets. Wind turbines are frequently located in remote areas with difficult and restricted access. The ability to monitor wear in real time and from a distance is of great importance in assessing the health and mitigating failure in the gearsets.

AB This work illustrates the updating and incorporation of information in the assessment of fatigue reliability for offshore wind turbine. The new information, coming from external and condition monitoring can be used to direct updating of the stochastic variables through a non-parametric Bayesian updating approach and be integrated in the reliability analysis by a third-order polynomial chaos expansion approximation. Although Classical Bayesian updating approaches are often used because of its parametric formulation, non-parametric approaches are better alternatives for multi-parametric updating with a non-conjugating formulation. The results in this paper show the influence on the time dependent updated reliability when non-parametric and classical Bayesian approaches are used. Further, the influence on the reliability of the number of updated parameters is illustrated.

AB The logistics and expense of obtaining oil samples from wind farms are among the conditions that make it challenging to establish a valuable condition monitoring program. Optimizing the oil condition monitoring program for a wind turbine is a critical step towards achieving forecasted ROI for the wind farm. To advance the current oil condition monitoring practices for most wind turbines, 150 identical wind turbine systems in the field for up to four years were studied. Several oil analysis tests were performed to understand the depletion of additives and changes in fluid chemistry. Basic statistical analysis was obtained on the data set to identify correlations in the data. The result of the analysis was a better understanding of the wind turbine oil's formulation and the relationship to fluid degradation and gearbox condition. The statistical methodology that we performed can be applied to other wind turbine farms to improve the knowledge derived from their oil analysis tests, both for gear as well hydraulic oils. In addition, other innovative tests were suggested which may augment a current oil analysis test slate to improve the value of their program.

ID VISCOSITY
AB Oil condition monitoring is a vital part of integrated asset health management. With an increasing impetus toward real-time decision making, delays incurred in offline laboratory oil analysis are becoming less acceptable. At present, several oil quality parameters can be monitored by commercially available sensors, and active research and development programmes are being pursued by both academic and industrial researchers to-develop robust, cost effective sensors for the remaining key parameters. Published (active) ASTM methods or practices do not yet cover the sensor technologies employed or under development, although work is in progress to address this deficit. This paper presents an overview of currently available oil condition sensors and looks at some recent developments, particularly in the following three areas: contamination by metallic wear debris, measurement of total water content, and determination of in-service oil viscosity. In each case, quite different technological solutions have been adopted. Where applicable, alignment and overlap with existing ASTM methods and practices will be reviewed and future directions indicated. Recent improvements in the sensitivity of inductive particle counters have enabled the detection of individual ferrous particles down to the sub-100 mu m diameter regime and close to the 100 mu m diameter mark for non-ferrous metals. Experiences of particle counters in wind turbine applications have shown the potential for enormous benefits in failure prevention. One standard practice covering the installation, operation, and requirements of such devices is published and a second is currently in draft mode. Online sensors utilising infrared transmission measurements recently have been developed by two independent companies. The systems are targeted primarily at marine diesel engine installations, although the method is not restricted solely to these applications. Maximum water content measurable depends on both the optical path length and the cleanliness of the oil. For marine applications a practical upper measurement limit of 1 % by volume has been adopted. In the system described here, a correction methodology, correlating to an accepted Deutsches Institut fur Normung-Fourier transform infrared standard, has been adopted to cope with oils contaminated by soot. Soot loading increases the opacity of the oil, causing a concomitant reduction in the maximum water content measurable. The correction procedure increases the accuracy of the water content measurement and additionally provides a determination of the soot content. Commercially available viscosity sensors include both the oscillating piston type and high frequency oscillating crystal designs; however, a cost effective device employing a low amplitude, mid -frequency vibrating sensor element has been developed recently. Key features include accurate measurements over a very wide viscosity range and an operating range that covers combustion engine oil temperatures and pressures. Correlation with existing ASTM methods and practices is presently limited to calibration aspects only.

   Energy Conversion System Maintance; AJAX
AB There is a constant need for the reduction of operational and maintenance costs of Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS). The most efficient way of reducing these costs would be to continuously monitor the condition of these systems, which allows for early detection of the degeneration of the generator health, facilitating a proactive response, minimizing downtime, and maximizing productivity. Wind generators are also inaccessible since they are situated on extremely high towers, which are usually 70m more in height. There are also plans to increase the number of offshore sites increasing the need for a remote means of WECS monitoring that overcomes some of the difficulties of accessibility problems. Therefore it is important of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in WECS. A monitoring scheme of transfer its monitor status with AJAX technology was put forwords in this paper. A remote condition monitoring platform (RCMP) was designed and constructed in this project. And its result brings us an effective solution to deal with the WECS condition monitoring.

AB Condition monitoring of machines working under non-stationary operations is one of the most challenging problems in maintenance. A wind turbine is an example of such class of machines. One of effective approaches may be to identify operating conditions and investigate their influence on used diagnostic features. Commonly used methods based on measurement of electric current, rotational speed, power and other process variables require additional equipment (sensors, acquisition cards) and software. It is proposed to use advanced signal processing techniques for instantaneous shaft speed recovery from a vibration signal. It may be used instead of extra channels or in parallel as signal verification.

AB This paper presents the research activity performed on a Small Wind Turbine (SWT) test stand. Commercially available turbine was modified towards incorporation of the sensors system for condition monitoring. Installed sensors measure angular shaft position, torque applied from the wind loads, vibration accelerations and last but not least rotational speed. All gathered data are then transferred and processed in Test. Lab by means of automatic in house developed Visual Basic application which afterwards converts TDF files to text files and stores them in a desired directory. The obtained signals can then be used as input parameters for AMESim simulation of the same Small Wind Turbine. The numerical simulation is being run in parallel to installed sensors measurements and is as well controlled by the same Visual Basic application. By having actual measurements and numerical simulation results one will be able to compare those two outcomes. In particular, if the numerical model is tailored to the physical one, data comparison will allow identifying malfunctioning due to component damage or extreme working condition.

AB Vibration analysis has found widespread application for condition monitoring in a variety of applications and industries. With the continual development of cheaper and more powerful processing hardware, such systems have developed from utilizing simple checks on amplitude to those based around sophisticated spectral analysis. Most current systems that are employed for rotating machines operate by examining the gain and phase of the spectral components at both the fundamental frequency of rotation and a number of higher order harmonics. These components are then compared with normal signatures and any deviation is used to declare possibility of a fault. Differences in specific spectral lines, for example harmonics associated with blade passing or gear meshing frequencies, can be used to diagnose particular faults. Such analysis, however, has proven to be difficult to automate and relies on the off-line interpretation of a trained vibration expert. The paper presents application of the model based diagnostics method for early detection of faults in rotating machinery. The proposed diagnostic system based on two methods - modal analysis (OMA and OMAX methods) and non-linear signals models (NARX). The paper presents the application of the powerful class of non-linear signal processing tools known as NARX in rotating machinery diagnostic. The paper also presents an application of OMAX method in rotating machinery diagnostic. The OMAX method is formulated with an assumption that both measurable and immeasurable forces excite shaft vibrations. The proposed system was verified during research on a specialized test rig, which can generate vibration signals and on data recorded at wind turbine.

AB To operate wind turbines safely and efficiently, condition monitoring for the main components are of increasing importance. Especially, the lack of access of offshore installations increases inspection and maintenance costs. The installation of a condition monitoring system will cause a decisive impact on reliability and maintenance and considerably reduce down times by condition dependent inspections. So far, such systems are installed only in a low percentage of the wind turbines. Furthermore, there is a limitation on monitoring of changes in Eigen frequencies. Usually, this type of information does not provide a spatial resolution necessary for damage detection and localization of structural changes. The current work at Fraunhofer IZFP Dresden in the field of monitoring of wind turbines is focused on the development of a condition monitoring systems for rotor blades. The monitoring concept is based on a combination of low frequency integral vibration monitoring and acoustic monitoring techniques in the frequency range between 10 kHz and 100 kHz using guided waves. The paper is focused on the results of the acoustic emission measurements that were used in a full-scale fatigue test at a rotor blade made from carbon-and glass fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP, GFRP) with an overall length of 40 meters. The spatial and temporal development of the acoustic emissions and their signal parameters can be used as damage indicator. Moreover, the test instrumentation and results of acoustic emission measurements on a rotating rotor blade are shown. When using acoustic emission on such a field installation one has to overcome additional parameters caused by environmental influences like rain and wind speed to name a few of them. It can be shown, that the acoustic emission hit rate correlates with wind speed.

AB Wind turbine blades have to withstand a high number of load cycles in mostly hard weather conditions over 20 years. In a research project BAM and several partners have designed, evaluated and tested a condition monitoring system for all parts of a wind turbine. At a rotorblade with a length of 58 m fibre bragg grating sensors were applied for in-service strain measurement. Additionally a complex test rig was designed to enable real biaxial loading conditions at a representative test rotor blade to simulate the mechanical loading conditions in the lab. In this test blade with a length of 8 m also fibre bragg grating sensors were implemented to determine their influences for the structure and the condition monitoring system. Vibration measurements were carried out at different test phases. The results were compared with finite element strain and modal analysis.

AB In recent years, rapid growth in wind energy as a substantial source of electricity generation has created greater demands on wind turbine system reliability and availability. To reduce service costs and maximize return on investment, wind farm operators have begun to take a more proactive approach to turbine problems by relying on intelligent condition monitoring and automated failure detection systems. The challenge is how to effectively convert large amounts of data into actionable decisions to detect and isolate failures at an early stage. This paper describes a unique data analysis and modeling technique for online turbine health monitoring and automatic root cause assessment. It provides a means to capture failure signatures for specific root causes based on historical events as well as engineering knowledge. Both continuous and discrete turbine condition monitoring data are processed to provide a failure probability assessment. First, statistical trend analysis, feature extraction and classification methods are developed to analyze a continuous sensor data set. Secondly, a pattern recognition method is applied to calculate failure indicators from various discrete control system events, or fault messages. Then failure likelihoods derived from both the continuous and the discrete models are combined in a fusion model to increase predictive accuracy. A demonstration of the method on bearing failure modeling using SCADA data will be provided with promising results.

AB The main driver behind developing advanced condition monitoring (CM) systems for the wind energy industry is the delivery of improved asset management regarding the operation and maintenance of the gearbox and other wind turbine components and systems. Current gearbox CM systems mainly detect faults by identifying ferrous materials, water and air within oil by changes in certain properties such as electrical fields. In order to detect oil degradation and identify particles, more advanced devices are required so allow a better maintenance regime to be established. Current technologies available specifically for this purpose include Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and ferrography. There are also several technologies that have not yet been or have been recently applied to CM problems. After reviewing the current state of the art, it is recommended that a combination of sensors would be used that analyse different characteristics of the oil. The information individually would not be highly accurate but combined, it is fully expected that greater accuracy can be obtained. The technologies that are suitable in terms of cost, size, accuracy and development are online ferrography, selective fluorescence spectroscopy, scattering measurements, FTIR, photoacoustic spectroscopy and solid state viscometers.

AB The rapid expansion of wind farms has drawn attention to operations and maintenance issues. Condition monitoring solutions have been developed to detect and diagnose abnormalities of various wind turbine subsystems with the goal of reducing operations and maintenance costs. This paper explores fault data provided by the supervisory control and data acquisition system and offers fault prediction at three levels: (1) fault and no-fault prediction; (2) fault category (severity): and (3) the specific fault prediction. For each level, the emerging faults are predicted 5-60 min before they occur. Various data-mining algorithms have been applied to develop models predicting possible faults. Computational results validating the models are provided. The research limitations are discussed. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO RENEWABLE ENERGY

   transformation (CWT); Morlet wavelet; Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD)
ID TERMS
AB Based on the Morlet wavelet transformation and Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), we present a wind turbine fault diagnosis method in this paper. Wind turbine can be damaged by moisture absorption, fatigue, wind gusts or lightening strikes. Due to this reason, there is an increasing need to monitor the health of these structures. Vibration analysis is the best-known technology applied in wind turbine condition monitoring, in which the time-frequency analysis techniques such as Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) are widely used. Theoretically WVD has an infinite resolution in time-frequency domain. For early wind turbine fault signals, however, there are two main difficulties in WVD analysis. One is strong noise signals in the background and the other is cross terms in WVD itself. In this paper, continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) is employed to filter useless noise in raw vibration signals, and auto terms window (ATW) function is used to suppress the cross terms in WVD. In the CWT de-noising process, the Morlet wavelet, whose shape is similar to mechanical shock signals, is chosen to perform CWT on the raw vibration signals. The appropriate scale parameter for CWT is optimized by the cross validation method (CVM). An ATW based on the Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (SPWVD) spectrum is taken to be a window function to suppress the cross terms in WVD. The new method can not only remove cross terms faraway from the auto terms, but also keep high energy close to every instantaneous frequency, the virtues such as high time-frequency resolution, and good energy aggregation etc. The wind turbine gear fault diagnosis experiment results indicate that the proposed method has a good de-nosing performance and is effective in suppressing the cross terms and extracting fault feature.

AB With an increasing number of wind turbines being erected offshore, there is a need for cost-effective, predictive, and proactive maintenance. A large fraction of wind turbine downtime is due to bearing failures, particularly in the generator and gearbox. One way of assessing impending problems is to install vibration sensors in key positions on these subassemblies. Such equipment can be costly and requires sophisticated software for analysis of the data. An alternative approach, which does not require extra sensors, is investigated in this paper. This involves monitoring the power output of a variable-speed wind turbine generator and processing the data using a wavelet in order to extract the strength of particular frequency components, characteristic of faults. This has been done for doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs), commonly used in modern variable-speed wind turbines. The technique is first validated on a test rig under controlled fault conditions and then is applied to two operational wind turbine DFIGs where generator shaft misalignment was detected. For one of these turbines, the technique detected a problem 3 months before a bearing failure was recorded.

AB A sound maintenance planning is of crucial importance for wind power systems. There is a large potential in cost savings by optimizing maintenance decisions to make the projects more cost-efficient. This paper presents an approach to optimize condition-based maintenance strategies for components which degradation can be classified according to the severity of the damage. The approach is applicable to inspection-based maintenance as well as maintenance based on online condition-monitoring systems. This enables us to compare the maintenance strategies within a unified framework. First decisions associated with the different maintenance strategies are optimized, then the expected life cycle maintenance costs of the strategies are compared. The model is applied to blades of wind turbine in order to compare three maintenance strategies: visual inspection, inspection with a condition-monitoring technique (e.g., ultrasonic or thermography), and online condition monitoring (e.g., fiber optic). It is shown that online condition monitoring is the optimal maintenance strategy for high failure rate and low crack time to failure. In other cases, inspection with condition-based maintenance is slightly more beneficial.

AB Wind turbine condition monitoring systems provide an early indication of component damage, allowing the operator to plan system repair prior to complete failure. However, the resulting cost savings are limited because of the relatively low number of failures that may be detected and the high cost of installing the required measurement equipment. A new approach is proposed for continuous, online calculation of damage accumulation using standard turbine performance parameters and Physics of Failure methodology. The wind turbine system is assessed in order to identify the root cause of critical failure modes and theoretical damage models are developed to describe the relationship between the turbine operating environment, applied loads and the rate at which damage accumulates. Accurate estimates may then be made in real time concerning the probability of failure for specific failure modes and components. The methodology is illustrated for a specific failure mode using a case study of a large wind farm where a significant number of gearbox failures occurred within a short space of time. Such an approach may be implemented at relatively low cost and offers potential for significant improvements in overall wind turbine maintenance strategy. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Wind energy is one of renewable energy sources, which is copiously available without any limitation. Wind turbines are used to tap the potential of wind energy. Thus, stability and reliability of wind turbine is critical to extract this maximum amount of energy from the wind. To keep the wind turbine in operation, implementation of condition monitoring is paramount. This paper, firstly, demonstrates the principle, the interrogation system and the selection of operational style of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. Secondly, condition monitoring in wind turbines by using embedded FBG sensors is described in details. Finally, questions and future are carried out. FBG sensor system can keep away the wind turbines from catastrophic conditions due to sudden breakdowns.

AB Previous condition monitoring products classify the wind turbine operation condition based on one operation parameter. And a series of monitoring alarm thresholds are defined for each one of the classified wind turbine operation conditions. This leads to a lot of false alarms during the application of condition monitoring system of wind turbine. This paper uses multiple operation parameters to classify the complex and non-stationary wind turbine operation conditions related to vibration. In this paper, after preprocessing the actual operation data of a wind turbine, the false alarm rate is defined as a rationality evaluation index of operation condition classification methods. Afterwards, this paper proposes respectively two multiple parameters classification methods based on rough sets and support vector machine to classify the normal operation condition of wind turbine and calculates the false alarm rate based on testing different operation condition classification methods. The test results show that the two intelligent methods can decrease the false alarm rate obviously. Finally, the test results of different operation condition classification methods are compared and analyzed.

AB Cost-effective wind turbine (WT) condition monitoring assumes more importance as turbine sizes increase and they are placed in more remote locations, for example, offshore. Conventional condition monitoring techniques, such as vibration, lubrication oil, and generator current signal analysis, require the deployment of a variety of sensors and computationally intensive analysis techniques. This paper describes a WT condition monitoring technique that uses the generator output power and rotational speed to derive a fault detection signal. The detection algorithm uses a continuous-wavelet-transform-based adaptive filter to track the energy in the prescribed time-varying fault-related frequency bands in the power signal. The central frequency of the filter is controlled by the generator speed, and the filter bandwidth is adapted to the speed fluctuation. Using this technique, fault features can be extracted, with low calculation times, from director indirect-drive fixed-or variable-speed WTs. The proposed technique has been validated experimentally on a WT drive train test rig. A synchronous or induction generator was successively installed on the test rig, and both mechanical and electrical fault-like perturbations were successfully detected when applied to the test rig.

AB The condition monitoring system is essential for a large-scale wind turbine system to maximize its availability and reliability. In order to develop its effective condition monitoring algorithms, a wind turbine simulator is necessary for such a large-scale system. However, the existing simulators consisting of a motor and a generator are not suitable for this purpose, because they have not the general configuration of wind turbine systems. To solve this problem, we are now developing a novel wind turbine simulator that is composed of blades, a step-up gearbox and a generator. This paper presents a developed condition monitoring system and the design procedure of the wind turbine simulator.

AB This paper presents the role of SeeByte's RECOVERY system within the wind energy industry, with specific focus on an offshore scenario. The current generation of condition monitoring systems (CMS) in relation to wind energy are generally provided by turbine manufacturers, or have been adapted from other industries. These systems have a propensity to focus explicitly on individual parts of the turbine (e. g. gearbox and bearings), therefore they are limited in monitoring scope and do not benefit from a system-wide view allowing an understanding of cause and effect across all parts of the turbine. This poor overview of the turbine system means that systems available today are seen as being prone to false alarms which lead to incorrect diagnosis (e. g. incorrect recognition of a sensor failure or of the cause of a vibration) and unnecessary intervention, the 'cry wolf' syndrome, where ultimately important warnings are ignored. In addition, this approach could lead to costly incorrect diagnoses.
   To fully realise the potential of condition monitoring and its impact on decision making/maintenance scheduling, RECOVERY, as a holistic condition monitoring system, is able to monitor the entire wind turbine in an integrated manner. This proposed holistic system takes a broad view of events and sensor values across the complete turbine system and subsystems (also across a complete farm) to improve diagnostic correctness and reduce no-fault-found situations.

AB As an clean renewable energy source wind energy is highly regarded by various countries in the world. Wind turbine blade is one of the most important components in wind turbine. It is the key component for receiving wind energy. As turbine size steps up and the size of modern turbine blade increases, condition monitoring and maintenance of blades become more important. Strain detection is one of the most effective methods to monitor blade condition. Sensitivity for EMC and lightning and zero drift of conventional strain gauges bring a lot of trouble. In this paper, a fibre Bragg grating sensor system is used for blade monitoring. The system overcomes the shortcomings. It is dainty, reliable, convenient to multiplex and so on.

AB The use of open-source software in many institutions and organizations is increasing. However, a balance should be considered between the software cost and the cost of its technical support and reliability. In this article, a maintenance system for wind farms will be presented. It is connected to an information system for maintenance, called SNIFF (Terology Integrated Modular System) as a general base to manage the assets and as a support strategic line to the evolution of this system, which incorporates on-condition maintenance modules, and the support to the research and development done around this theme. The SMIT system is based on a TCP/IP network, using a Linux server running a PostgreSQL database and Apache web server with PHP, and Octave and R software for numerical analysis. Maintenance technicians, chiefs, economic and production management personnel can access SMIT database through SMIT clients for Windows. In addition, this maintenance system for wind systems uses also special low cost hardware for data acquisition on floor level. The hardware uses a distributed TCP/IP network to synchronize SMIT server master clock through Precision Time Protocol. Usually, the manufactures construct, deploy and give the means for the suppliers to perform the wind system's maintenance. This is a very competitive area, where companies tend to hide the development details and implementations. Within this scenario, the development of maintenance management models for multiple wind equipments is important, and will allow countries to be more competitive in a growing market. For on-condition monitoring, the algorithms are based on Support Vector Machines and time series analysis running under Octave and R open-source software's.

AB This paper presents the research activity performed on the Small Wind System test stand. Commercially available turbine was modified towards incorporation of the sensors system for condition monitoring. Installed sensors measure angular shaft position, torque applied from the wind loads and vibration accelerations and last but not least rotational speed. All gathered data is then transferred and processed in Test. Lab all by means of automatic in house developed visual basic application which afterwards converts TDF files to text files and stores them in desired directory. Obtained signals are used as input parameters for AMESim simulation of the same Small Wind System. The numerical simulation is being run in parallel to installed sensors measurements and is as well controlled by the same visual basic application. Having real measurements and numerical simulation results one will be able to compare those two outcomes.(1)

AB To operate wind turbines safely and efficiently, condition monitoring for the main components are of increasing importance. Especially, the lack of access of offshore installations increases inspection and maintenance costs. The installation of a condition monitoring system will cause a decisive impact on reliability and maintenance and considerably reduce shut off times by condition dependent inspections. So far, such systems are installed only in a low percentage of the wind turbines. Furthermore, there is a limitation on monitoring of changes in eigenfrequencies. Usually, this type of information does not provide a spatial resolution necessary for damage detection and localisation of structural changes. The current work at Fraunhofer IZFP Dresden in the field of monitoring of wind turbines is focused on the development of a condition monitoring systems for rotor blades. The monitoring concept is based on a combination of low frequency integral vibration monitoring and acoustic monitoring techniques in the frequency range between 10 kHz and 100 kHz using guided waves. A joint application of acousto ultrasonics and acoustic emission techniques are used. The following paper explains the acoustic emission measurements in detail. Results of acoustic emission monitoring are shown based on measurements of a currently running dynamic fatigue test at a 40 m rotor blade.
