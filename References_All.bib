While these tools have dramatically improved the state of NLG, particularly for low resources tasks, state-of-the-art NLG models still face many challenges: a lack of diversity in generated text, commonsense violations in depicted situations, difficulties in making use of factual information, and difficulties in designing reliable evaluation metrics. In this tutorial, we will present an overview of the current state-of-the-art in neural network architectures, and how they shaped recent research directions in text generation.

	abstract = {Reservoir characterization is an inverse problem where parameter values associated to the properties of the porous media, are estimated. In this problem, the pressure data and its log-derivative curves are used in the fitting process. However, the numerical differentiation needed to generate the log-derivative curve, is an ill-posed problem where the noise in the data can be largely propagated. This noise can produce several spurious local minima in the objective function and prevents to get a precise approximation to the parameters. Therefore, an efficient noise reduction method is required to achieve the desired accuracy in the parameter values.

In this work, we explore three noise reduction methods by applying them to well-test data. These methods are based on multi-step finite differences and splines, but using a machine-learning approach.

In addition, a new method is proposed which produce an optimal curve which is a linear combination of multiple data curves, that are approximations to the solution of the inverse problem.

We show how these methods which use information from the forward model are more effcient for noise reduction. The proposed methods can be used in many inverse problems where there is a mathematical model meant to describe the measured data.}

However, the impact of label noise has not received sufficient attention. Recent studies have shown that label noise can significantly impact the performance of deep learning models in many machine learning and computer vision applications. This is especially concerning for medical applications, where datasets are typically small, labeling requires domain expertise and suffers from high inter- and intra-observer variability, and erroneous predictions may influence decisions that directly impact human health. In this paper, we first review the state-of-the-art in handling label noise in deep learning. Then, we review studies that have dealt with label noise in deep learning for medical image analysis. Our review shows that recent progress on handling label noise in deep learning has gone largely unnoticed by the medical image analysis community. To help achieve a better understanding of the extent of the problem and its potential remedies, we conducted experiments with three medical imaging datasets with different types of label noise, where we investigated several existing strategies and developed new methods to combat the negative effect of label noise. Based on the results of these experiments and our review of the literature, we have made recommendations on methods that can be used to alleviate the effects of different types of label noise on deep models trained for medical image analysis. We hope that this article helps the medical image analysis researchers and developers in choosing and devising new techniques that effectively handle label noise in deep learning."

In our study, we performed a systematic literature review of noise identification and handling studies published in various conferences and journals between January 1993 to July 2018. We have identified 79 primary studies are of noise identification and noise handling techniques. After investigating these studies, we found that among the noise identification schemes, the accuracy of identification of noisy instances by using ensemble-based techniques are better than other techniques. But regarding efficiency, usually single based techniques method is better; it is more suitable for noisy data sets. Among noise handling techniques, polishing techniques generally improve classification accuracy than filtering and robust techniques, but it introduced some errors in the data sets."

The method was evaluated according to two different possibilities: (a) including vectors of samples with and without missing data in the training data set and (b) pre-training a SOM for a data set with no missing values and then making imputations for a second data set (prediction set) of samples with missing values. Evaluations were made using a surface water data set of 270 samples from Reconquista River, in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, by artificially setting a range of 17% to 39% of the data to missing. Results were compared to imputations made through professional criteria. SOMs gave reasonable estimates, with no statistically significant differences from estimates made through professional criteria, proving thus to be a suitable time-saving imputation method."

Missing data imputation is an important task in cases where it is crucial to use all available data and not discard records with missing values. This work evaluates the performance of several statistical and machine learning imputation methods that were used to predict recurrence in patients in an extensive real breast cancer data set.
Materials and methods
Imputation methods based on statistical techniques, e.g., mean, hot-deck and multiple imputation, and machine learning techniques, e.g., multi-layer perceptron (MLP), self-organisation maps (SOM) and k-nearest neighbour (KNN), were applied to data collected through the “El Álamo-I” project, and the results were then compared to those obtained from the listwise deletion (LD) imputation method. The database includes demographic, therapeutic and recurrence-survival information from 3679 women with operable invasive breast cancer diagnosed in 32 different hospitals belonging to the Spanish Breast Cancer Research Group (GEICAM). The accuracies of predictions on early cancer relapse were measured using artificial neural networks (ANNs), in which different ANNs were estimated using the data sets with imputed missing values.
Results
The imputation methods based on machine learning algorithms outperformed imputation statistical methods in the prediction of patient outcome. Friedman’s test revealed a significant difference (p=0.0091) in the observed area under the ROC curve (AUC) values, and the pairwise comparison test showed that the AUCs for MLP, KNN and SOM were significantly higher (p=0.0053, p=0.0048 and p=0.0071, respectively) than the AUC from the LD-based prognosis model.
Conclusion
The methods based on machine learning techniques were the most suited for the imputation of missing values and led to a significant enhancement of prognosis accuracy compared to imputation methods based on statistical procedures."

The classic imputation strategy based on the K nearest neighbours (KNN) has been widely used to solve the plague problem. However, former studies do not give much attention to feature relevance, which has a significant impact on the selection of nearest neighbours. As a result, biased results may appear in similarity measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel method to impute missing data, named feature weighted grey KNN (FWGKNN) imputation algorithm. This approach employs mutual information (MI) to measure feature relevance. We present an experimental evaluation for five UCI datasets in three missingness mechanisms with various missing rates. Experimental results show that feature relevance has a non-ignorable influence on missing data estimation based on grey theory, and our method is considered superior to the other four estimation strategies. Moreover, the classification bias can be significantly reduced by using our approach in classification tasks.}, journal = {Applied Intelligence}, month = oct, pages = {614–632}, numpages = {19}, keywords = {Feature relevance, Grey theory, K nearest neighbours, Missing data, Mutual information} }

As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

However, in many real-life situations the distribution of examples is skewed since the examples of some of the classes appear much more frequently. This poses a difficulty to learning algorithms, as they will be biased towards the majority classes. In recent years many solutions have been proposed to tackle imbalanced classification, yet they mainly concentrate on binary scenarios. Multi-class imbalanced problems are far more difficult as the relationships between the classes are no longer straightforward. Additionally, one should analyze not only the imbalance ratio but also the characteristics of the objects within each class. In this paper we present a study on oversampling for multi-class imbalanced datasets that focuses on the analysis of the class characteristics. We detect subsets of specific examples in each class and fix the oversampling for each of them independently. Thus, we are able to use information about the class structure and boost the more difficult and important objects. We carry an extensive experimental analysis, which is backed-up with statistical analysis, in order to check when the preprocessing of some types of examples within a class may improve the indiscriminate preprocessing of all the examples in all the classes. The results obtained show that oversampling concrete types of examples may lead to a significant improvement over standard multi-class preprocessing that do not consider the importance of example types."

ABSTRACT = {The use of clean and renewable energy sources is increasingly important, for economic and environmental reasons. Wind plays a key role among renewable energy sources. Hence, the location, monitoring and maintenance of wind turbines are areas that have received more and more attention in recent years. The paper presents a survey of datasets of wind resources, wind farm installed capacity and wind farm operation, which contain generous amounts of data. Those datasets are important tools, freely available for analysis of wind resources and study of the performance of wind turbines. A short analysis of one of the datasets is also presented, identifying different operational regions, and the ones more likely to aggregate failures. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to study wind turbines&rsquo; behavior.},

	abstract = {Wind turbine failure and downtime can often compromise the profitability of a wind farm due to their high impact on the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. Early detection of failures can facilitate the changeover from corrective maintenance towards a predictive approach. This paper presents a cost-effective methodology to combine various alarm analysis techniques, using data from the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, in order to detect component failures. The approach categorises the alarms according to a reviewed taxonomy, turning overwhelming data into valuable information to assess component status. Then, different alarms analysis techniques are applied for two purposes: the evaluation of the SCADA alarm system capability to detect failures, and the investigation of the relation between components faults being followed by failure occurrences in others. Various case studies are presented and discussed. The study highlights the relationship between faulty behaviour in different components and between failures and adverse environmental conditions.}

	abstract = {Using 10-minute wind turbine SCADA data for fault prediction offers an attractive way of gaining additional prognostic capabilities without needing to invest in extra hardware. To use these data-driven methods effectively, the historical SCADA data must be labelled with the periods when the turbine was in faulty operation as well the sub-system the fault was attributed to. Manually identifying faults using maintenance logs can be effective, but is also highly time consuming and tedious due to the disparate nature of these logs across manufacturers, operators and even individual maintenance events. Turbine alarm systems can help to identify these periods, but the sheer volume of alarms and false positives generated makes analysing them on an individual basis ineffective. In this work, we present a new method for automatically identifying historical stoppages on the turbine using SCADA and alarms data. Each stoppage is associated with either a fault in one of the turbine’s sub-systems, a routine maintenance activity, a grid-related event or a number of other categories. This is then checked against maintenance logs for accuracy and the labelled data fed into a classifier for predicting when these stoppages will occur. Results show that the automated labelling process correctly identifies each type of stoppage, and can be effectively used for SCADA-based prediction of turbine faults.}

ABSTRACT = {In order to remain competitive, wind turbines must be reliable machines with efficient and effective maintenance strategies. However, thus far, wind turbine reliability information has been closely guarded by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and turbine reliability studies often rely on data that are not always in a usable or consistent format. In addition, issues with turbine maintenance logs and alarm system data can make it hard to identify historical periods of faulty operation. This means that building new and effective data-driven condition monitoring techniques and methods can be challenging, especially those that rely on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system data. Such data are rarely standardised, resulting in challenges for researchers in contextualising these data. This work aims to summarise some of the issues seen in previous studies, highlighting the common problems seen by researchers working in the areas of condition monitoring and reliability analysis. Standards and policy initiatives that aim to alleviate some of these problems are given, and a summary of their recommendations is presented. The main finding from this work is that industry would benefit hugely from unified standards for turbine taxonomies, alarm codes, SCADA operational data and maintenance and fault reporting.},

abstract = "Wind turbine installation is growing consistently and fast. Wind turbines are getting bigger in size and power, what incurs that a simple unit breakdown causes large energy losses. They operate under varying, complex and dynamic loads due to the environmental conditions, such as wind shear, turbulence, gusts, etc. Condition-based and prognostic and health maintenance is key to assure reliable and efficient performance of wind farms, especially offshore. Fault diagnosis is important, but given the operational complexity of the wind turbines, previous knowledge about the condition of a wind turbine component and fault prognostics are the state of the art of wind farm operation. Although some advance has been made in the diagnostics of faults of wind turbines, very little research has been carried out in the field of fault prognostics of wind turbines. Then, there is an urgent need to develop prognostic techniques for such complex systems operating in real conditions. This article aims to present a comprehensive, specific and concise review of the up to date efforts and advances in the research of prognostic techniques and remaining useful life estimation methods applied to the critical components of wind turbines and analyse its advantages, capabilities and limitations."

	abstract     = {Aquaculture within offshore wind farms has been identified as one of the many possibilities of smart use of marine space, leading to opportunities for innovative entrepreneurship. Offshore areas potentially pose less conflict with co-users than onshore. At the same time, offshore areas and offshore constructions are prone to high technical risks through mechanical force, corrosion, and biofouling. The expected lifetime of an offshore structure is to a great extent determined by the risk of failures. This chapter elaborates on logistical challenges that the offshore industry faces. Operation and maintenance (O{\&}M) activities typically represent a big part of the total costs (e.g. 25--30{\%} of the total lifecycle costs for offshore wind farms). The offshore wind energy sector is considered an industry with promising features for the public and private sector. Large wind farms farther off the coast pose high expectations because of higher average wind speeds and hence greater wind energy yield (in terms of megawatts per capital). These conditions entail additional challenges in logistics, though. One of the main hurdles that hinders use of offshore wind energy is the high cost for O{\&}M. The offshore wind industry will have to solve these problems in order to achieve substantial cost reduction - alone or jointly with other (potential) users. It is precisely the logistical problems around O{\&}M where most likely synergy benefits of multi-use platforms (MUPs) can be achieved. The offshore wind energy industry is eagerly looking for technical innovations. Until now they mostly sought the solutions in their own circles. If the combination of offshore wind energy and offshore aquaculture proves to be feasible and profitable in practice, there may be an additional possibility to reduce the O{\&}M costs by synergy effects of the combined operations. Logistic waiting times, for example, can result in substantial revenue losses, whereas timely spare-parts supply or sufficient repair capacity (technicians) to shorten the logistic delay times are beneficial. A recent study suggests that a cost reduction of 10{\%} is feasible, if the offshore wind and offshore aquaculture sectors are combined in order to coordinate and share O{\&}M together. The presented asset management control model proves useful in testing the innovative, interdisciplinary multi-use concepts, simulating return rates under different assumptions, thus making the approach more concrete and robust.}

Motivated by how humans tend to summarize tabular data, we propose a simple yet effective approach and show that it not only demonstrates strong performance but also provides good generalization across domains. The design of the model architecture is based on two aspects: content selection from input data and language modeling to compose coherent sentences, which can be acquired from prior knowledge. With just 200 training examples, across multiple domains, we show that our approach achieves very reasonable performances and outperforms the strongest baseline by an average of over 8.0 BLEU points improvement.

In addition, we propose two data augmentation methods that succeed to further improve performance of the resulting generation models.

In this paper, we review unsupervised and supervised applications of artificial neural networks and in particular of Deep Learning to condition monitoring in wind turbines. We find that – despite a promising performance of supervised methods – unsupervised approaches are prevalent in the literature. To explain this phenomenon, we discuss a range of issues related to obtaining labelled data sets for supervised training, namely quality and access as well as labelling and class imbalance of operational data. Furthermore, we find that the application of Deep Learning to SCADA data is impeded by their relatively low dimensionality, and we suggest ways of working with higher-dimensional SCADA data.}

While forecasts are most often evaluated based on squared or absolute errors, these error measures do not always adequately reflect the loss functions and true expectations of the forecast user, neither do they provide enough information for the desired evaluation task. Over the last decade, research in forecast verification has intensified, and a number of verification frameworks and diagnostic tools have been proposed. However, the corresponding literature is generally very technical and most often dedicated to forecast model developers. This can make forecast users struggle to select the most appropriate verification tools for their application while not fully appraising subtleties related to their application and interpretation. This paper revisits the most common verification tools from a forecast user perspective and discusses their suitability for different application examples as well as evaluation setup design and significance of evaluation results.}

Machine learning approaches are used to induce the underlying rules for text summarization, which are potentially close to the ones that humans use to generate textual summaries.

	abstract     = {In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.}

	abstract     = {Abstract The yaw angle control of a wind turbine allows maximization of the power absorbed from the wind and, thus, the increment of the system efficiency. Conventionally, classical control algorithms have been used for the yaw angle control of wind turbines. Nevertheless, in recent years, advanced control strategies have been designed and implemented for this purpose. These advanced control strategies are considered to offer improved features in comparison to classical algorithms. In this paper, an advanced yaw control strategy based on reinforcement learning (RL) is designed and verified in simulation environment. The proposed RL algorithm considers multivariable states and actions, as well as the mechanical loads due to the yaw rotation of the wind turbine nacelle and rotor. Furthermore, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Pareto optimal front (PoF)-based algorithm have been developed in order to find the optimal actions that satisfy the compromise between the power gain and the mechanical loads due to the yaw rotation. Maximizing the power generation and minimizing the mechanical loads in the yaw bearings in an automatic way are the objectives of the proposed RL algorithm. The data of the matrices Q (s,a) of the RL algorithm are stored as continuous functions in an artificial neural network (ANN) avoiding any quantification problem. The NREL 5-MW reference wind turbine has been considered for the analysis, and real wind data from Salt Lake, Utah, have been used for the validation of the designed yaw control strategy via simulations with the aeroelastic code FAST.}

The algorithm consists of the following two parts: The first part is the ReliefF multi-classification feature selection algorithm. According to the SCADA history data and the wind turbines fault record, the ReliefF algorithm is used to select feature parameters that are highly correlated with common faults. The second part is the XGBoost fault recognition algorithm. First of all, we use the historical data records as the input, and use the ReliefF algorithm to select the SCADA system observation features with high correlation with the fault classification, then use these feature data to build the XGBoost multi classification fault identification model, and finally we input the monitoring data generated by the actual running wind turbine into the XGBoost model to get the operation status of the wind turbine. We compared the algorithm proposed in this paper with other algorithms, such as radial basis function-Support Vector Machine (rbf-SVM) and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) classification algorithms, and the results showed that the classification accuracy using &ldquo;ReliefF + XGBoost&rdquo; algorithm was higher than other algorithms.}

However, most of the current fault detection approaches are realized by setting a single alarm threshold. Considering the complicated working conditions of wind farms, such methods are prone to ignore the fault, send out a false alarm, or leave insufficient troubleshooting time. In this work, we propose a gearbox fault prediction approach of wind turbines based on the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data. A stacking model composed of Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) was constructed as the normal behavior model to describe the normal conditions of the wind turbines. We used the Mahalanobis distance (MD) instead of the residual to measure the deviation of the current state from the normal conditions of the turbines. By inputting the MD series into the proposed change-point detection algorithm, we can obtain the change point at which the fault symptom begins to appear, and thus achieving the fault prediction of the gearbox. The proposed approach is validated on the historical data of 5 wind turbines in a wind farm, which proves its effectiveness to detect the fault in advance.}

This paper proposes the seasonal and trend adjustment attention encoder&ndash;decoder (STA&ndash;AED), a hybrid short-term load forecasting approach based on a multi-head attention encoder&ndash;decoder module with seasonal and trend adjustment. A seasonal and trend decomposing technique is used to preprocess the original electrical load data. Each decomposed datum is regressed to predict the future electric load value by utilizing the encoder&ndash;decoder network with the multi-head attention mechanism. With the multi-head attention mechanism, STA&ndash;AED can interpret the prediction results more effectively. A large number of experiments and extensive comparisons have been carried out with a load forecasting dataset from the United States. The proposed hybrid STA&ndash;AED model is superior to the other five counterpart models such as random forest, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), gated recurrent units (GRUs), Encoder&ndash;Decoder, and Encoder&ndash;Decoder with multi-head attention. The proposed hybrid model shows the best prediction accuracy in 14 out of 15 zones in terms of both root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).}

Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one.In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally varound the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

	abstract     = {Wind power penetration has increased rapidly in recent years. In winter, the wind turbine blade imbalance fault caused by ice accretion increase the maintenance costs of wind farms. It is necessary to detect the fault before blade breakage occurs. Preliminary analysis of time series simulation data shows that it is difficult to detect the imbalance faults by traditional mathematical methods, as there is little difference between normal and fault conditions. A deep learning method for wind turbine blade imbalance fault detection and classification is proposed in this paper. A long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model is built to extract the characteristics of the fault signal. The attention mechanism is built into the LSTM to increase its performance. The simulation results show that the proposed approach can detect the imbalance fault with an accuracy of over 98%, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed approach on wind turbine blade imbalance fault detection.}

	abstract     = {Wind energy is the most used renewable energy worldwide second only to hydropower. However, the stochastic nature of wind speed makes it harder for wind farms to manage the future power production and maintenance schedules efficiently. Many wind speed prediction models exist that focus on advance neural networks and/or preprocessing techniques to improve the accuracy. Since most of these models require a large amount of historic wind data and are validated using the data split method, the application to real-world scenarios cannot be determined. In this paper, we present a multi-step univariate prediction model for wind speed data inspired by the residual U-net architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN). We propose a residual dilated causal convolutional neural network (Res-DCCNN) with nonlinear attention for multi-step-ahead wind speed forecasting. Our model can outperform long-term short-term memory networks (LSTM), gated recurrent units (GRU), and Res-DCCNN using sliding window validation techniques for 50-step-ahead wind speed prediction. We tested the performance of the proposed model on six real-world wind speed datasets with different probability distributions to confirm its effectiveness, and using several error metrics, we demonstrated that our proposed model was robust, precise, and applicable to real-world cases.}

The proposed approach, xDNN is using prototypes. Prototypes are actual training data samples (images), which are local peaks of the empirical data distribution called typicality as well as of the data density. This generative model is identified in a closed form and equates to the pdf but is derived automatically and entirely from the training data with no user- or problem-specific thresholds, parameters or intervention. The proposed xDNN offers a new deep learning architecture that combines reasoning and learning in a synergy. It is non-iterative and non-parametric, which explains its efficiency in terms of time and computational resources. From the user perspective, the proposed approach is clearly understandable to human users. We tested it on challenging problems as the classification of different lighting conditions for driving scenes (iROADS), object detection (Caltech-256, and Caltech-101), and SARS-CoV-2 identification via computed tomography scan (COVID CT-scans dataset). xDNN outperforms the other methods including deep learning in terms of accuracy, time to train and offers an explainable classifier.}

The work makes substantial theoretical and methodological contributions to progressive knowledge domain visualization. A specialty is conceptualized and visualized as a time-variant duality between two fundamental concepts in information science: research fronts and intellectual bases. A research front is defined as an emergent and transient grouping of concepts and underlying research issues. The intellectual base of a research front is its citation and co-citation footprint in scientific literature—an evolving network of scientific publications cited by research-front concepts. Kleinberg's (2002) burst-detection algorithm is adapted to identify emergent research-front concepts. Freeman's (1979) betweenness centrality metric is used to highlight potential pivotal points of paradigm shift over time. Two complementary visualization views are designed and implemented: cluster views and time-zone views. The contributions of the approach are that (a) the nature of an intellectual base is algorithmically and temporally identified by emergent research-front terms, (b) the value of a co-citation cluster is explicitly interpreted in terms of research-front concepts, and (c) visually prominent and algorithmically detected pivotal points substantially reduce the complexity of a visualized network. The modeling and visualization process is implemented in CiteSpace II, a Java application, and applied to the analysis of two research fields: mass extinction (1981–2004) and terrorism (1990–2003). Prominent trends and pivotal points in visualized networks were verified in collaboration with domain experts, who are the authors of pivotal-point articles. Practical implications of the work are discussed. A number of challenges and opportunities for future studies are identified.}

In the proposed DNN-MRT scheme, deep auto-encoders act as base-regressors, whereas Deep Belief Network is used as a meta-regressor. Employing the concept of ensemble learning facilitates robust and collective decision on test data, whereas deep base and meta-regressors ultimately enhance the performance of the proposed DNN-MRT approach. The concept of transfer learning not only saves time required during training of a base-regressor on each individual wind farm dataset from scratch but also stipulates good weight initialization points for each of the wind farm for training. The effectiveness of the proposed, DNN-MRT technique is expressed by comparing statistical performance measures in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and standard deviation error (SDE) with other existing techniques.}

The use of machine learning algorithms of advanced neural network applied for engineering problems is increasing recently. The present paper therefore brings as important connection between these latest machine learning methods and engineering analysis of complex wind turbine blades which are also the focus of researchers in renewable system design and analysis. First, a nonlinear autoregressive network with external inputs neural network model using Levenberg–Marquardt back propagation feed forward algorithm is developed with 5 years of environment parameters as input. Similarly, a long short-term memory based model is developed and compared. The chosen long short-term memory model is used for developing two-year wind speed forecast. This wind pattern is used to create time varying loads on blade sections and cross-verified with National Renewable Energy Laboratory tools. A high-fidelity CAD model of the NREL 5 MW blade is developed and the fatigue analysis of the blade is carried out using the stress life approach with load ratio based on cohesive zone modeling. The blade is found to have available life of about 23.6 years. Thus, an integrated methodology is developed involving high-fidelity modeling of the composite material blade, wind speed forecasting using multiple environmental parameters using latest deep learning methods for machine learning, dynamic wind load calculation, and fatigue analysis for National Renewable Energy Laboratory blade.}

	abstract     = {Gearboxes are critical transmission components in the drivetrain of wind turbine, which have a dominant failure rate and the highest downtime loss in all wind turbine subsystems. However, load variations of wind turbine gearbox are far from smooth and usually nondeterministic, which result in inconsistent data distributions. To solve the problem, a novel performance degradation assessment and prognosis method based on maximum mean discrepancy is proposed to test the difference between data distributions and extract the characteristics of multi-source working conditions data. Besides, the increase in sensors will bring more difficulties to establish prediction models in real-world scenarios due to different installation locations. In view of this, a transfer learning strategy called joint distribution adaptation is utilized to adapt data distribution between multi-sensor signals. Nevertheless, the presence of background noise of wind turbine signals restricts the applicability of these algorithms in practice. To further reduce the distribution difference, a novel criterion is proposed to evaluate and measure the data distribution difference between known and tested working conditions based on the witness function of maximum mean discrepancy. The application and superiority of proposed methodology are validated using a wind turbine gearbox life-cycle test data set. Meanwhile, model comparison and cross-verification are conducted between conventional and proposed prediction models. The results indicate that the proposed method has a better performance in performance degradation assessment for wind turbine gearbox.}

This approach requires a large number of training examples and performs best for well-defined and narrow tasks. Transfer learning refers to a set of methods that extend this approach by leveraging data from additional domains or tasks to train a model with better generalization properties. Over the last two years, the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has witnessed the emergence of several transfer learning methods and architectures which significantly improved upon the state-of-the-art on a wide range of NLP tasks. These improvements together with the wide availability and ease of integration of these methods are reminiscent of the factors that led to the success of pretrained word embeddings and ImageNet pretraining in computer vision, and indicate that these methods will likely become a common tool in the NLP landscape as well as an important research direction. We will present an overview of modern transfer learning methods in NLP, how models are pre-trained, what information the representations they learn capture, and review examples and case studies on how these models can be integrated and adapted in downstream NLP tasks.}

	abstract     = {As a type of clean and renewable energy source, wind power is widely used. However, owing to the uncertainty of wind speed, it is essential to build an accurate forecasting model for large-scale wind power penetration. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) and data-driven modeling are two typical paradigms. NWP is usually unavailable or spatially insufficient. Data-driven modeling is an effective candidate. As to some newly-built wind farms, sufficient historical data is not available for training an accurate model, while some older wind farms may have long-term wind speed records. A question arises regarding whether the prediction model trained by data coming from older farms is also effective for a newly-built farm. In this paper, we propose an interesting trial of transferring the information obtained from data-rich farms to a newly-built farm. It is well known that deep learning can extract a high-level representation of raw data. We introduce deep neural networks, trained by data from data-rich farms, to extract wind speed patterns, and then finely tune the mapping with data coming from newly-built farms. In this way, the trained network transfers information from one farm to another. The experimental results show that prediction errors are significantly reduced using the proposed technique.}

There are numerous features that make decommissioning a challenge, such as the marine environment, the technical limitations of vessels and the lack of specific regulations that determine what should be done, increasing the uncertainty of the process. Additionally, the unique characteristics of the sites involve exclusive optimal solutions for each project. This article analyses the main operation parameters that affect the decommissioning process, identifying the benefits and drawbacks of the influencing variables. A model is designed to compare different transportation strategies, searching for cost reduction. A decommissioning methodology is been proposed based on this analysis, taking into consideration the technical aspects of the process, and minimising environmental impacts.

	abstract     = {Atmospheric conditions have a clear influence on wake effects. Stability classification is usually based on wind speed, turbulence intensity, shear and temperature gradients measured partly at met masts, buoys or LiDARs. The objective of this paper is to find a classification for stability based on wind turbine Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) measurements in order to fit engineering wake models better to the current ambient conditions. Two offshore wind farms with met masts have been used to establish a correlation between met mast stability classification and new aggregated statistical signals based on multiple measurement devices. The significance of these new signals on power production is demonstrated for two wind farms with met masts and validated against data from one further wind farm without a met mast. We found a good correlation between the standard deviation of active power divided by the average power of wind turbines in free flow with the ambient turbulence intensity when the wind turbines were operating in partial load.}

	abstract     = {The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in a smart society, in which the analysis of human habits is mandatory, requires automated data scheduling and analysis using smart applications, a smart infrastructure, smart systems, and a smart network. In this context, which is characterized by a large gap between training and operative processes, a dedicated method is required to manage and extract the massive amount of data and the related information mining. The method presented in this work aims to reduce this gap with near-zero-failure advanced diagnostics (AD) for smart management, which is exploitable in any context of Society 5.0, thus reducing the risk factors at all management levels and ensuring quality and sustainability. We have also developed innovative applications for a human-centered management system to support scheduling in the maintenance of operative processes, for reducing training costs, for improving production yield, and for creating a human–machine cyberspace for smart infrastructure design. The results obtained in 12 international companies demonstrate a possible global standardization of operative processes, leading to the design of a near-zero-failure intelligent system that is able to learn and upgrade itself. Our new method provides guidance for selecting the new generation of intelligent manufacturing and smart systems in order to optimize human–machine interactions, with the related smart maintenance and education.}

	abstract     = {Wind turbine power output is known to be a strong function of wind speed, but is also affected by turbulence and shear. In this work, new aerostructural simulations of a generic 1.5 MW turbine are used to rank atmospheric influences on power output. Most significant is the hub height wind speed, followed by hub height turbulence intensity and then wind speed shear across the rotor disk. These simulation data are used to train regression trees that predict the turbine response for any combination of wind speed, turbulence intensity, and wind shear that might be expected at a turbine site. For a randomly selected atmospheric condition, the accuracy of the regression tree power predictions is three times higher than that from the traditional power curve methodology. The regression tree method can also be applied to turbine test data and used to predict turbine performance at a new site. No new data are required in comparison to the data that are usually collected for a wind resource assessment. Implementing the method requires turbine manufacturers to create a turbine regression tree model from test site data. Such an approach could significantly reduce bias in power predictions that arise because of the different turbulence and shear at the new site, compared to the test site.}

	abstract     = {This paper presents a discussion of the development of wind energy generation in the United Kingdom and the challenges faced by the wind industry including reliability, performance and condition monitoring, particularly in the offshore environment. The worldwide installed capacity of offshore wind has now risen to over 7 GW, with an ever increasing deployment rate of new assets. About 90\% of the global currently installed capacity is in Northern Europe, with the United Kingdom having the world's largest share at 4 GW. Capacity factor data from UK offshore wind farms is presented, providing an insight into the current performance of large Round 2 offshore wind farms compared to the earlier Round 1 farms and to onshore farms. The data reveal that the United Kingdom's Round 2 offshore farms are achieving an average monthly capacity factor of 38.3\% with a peak value of 75.8\%. The older Round 1 farms have a lower average capacity factor of 33.6\% while large onshore farms with capacities above 100 MW have achieved 25.6\%. Offshore wind turbine performance has improved over time, and the industry is applying the learning from early experiences to achieve better performances at the more recently installed farms. Despite these improvements in turbine availability, the cost of energy from wind, particularly offshore, remains too high for it to be a commercially viable form of generation without subsidies. Reducing the cost of energy from wind to economically sustainable levels is the most important challenge facing the industry today. Operation and maintenance costs constitute up to 30 \% of the total cost of energy from wind in large farms. The industry must overcome the challenges associated with improving component reliability and the development and adoption by operators of appropriate condition monitoring systems and maintenance strategies, in order to reduce costs to sustainable levels. Research and development work carried out with these goals in mind is also reviewed in the paper.}

	abstract     = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).}

	abstract     = {Due to growing interest in wind energy harvesting offshore as well as in the urban environment, vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) have recently received renewed interest. Their omni-directional capability makes them a very interesting option for use with the frequently varying wind directions typically encountered in the built environment while their scalability and low installation costs make them highly suitable for offshore wind farms. However, they require further performance optimization to become competitive with horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) as they currently have a lower power coefficient (CP). This can be attributed both to the complexity of the flow around VAWTs and the significantly smaller amount of research they have received. The pitch angle is a potential parameter to enhance the performance of VAWTs. The current study investigates the variations in loads and moments on the turbine as well as the experienced angle of attack, shed vorticity and boundary layer events (leading edge and trailing edge separation, laminar-to-turbulent transition) as a function of pitch angle using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) calculations. Pitch angles of −7° to +3° are investigated using Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) calculations while turbulence is modeled with the 4-equation transition SST model. The results show that a 6.6% increase in CP can be achieved using a pitch angle of −2° at a tip speed ratio of 4. Additionally, it is found that a change in pitch angle shifts instantaneous loads and moments between upwind and downwind halves of the turbine. The shift in instantaneous moment during the revolution for various pitch angles suggests that dynamic pitching might be a very promising approach for further performance optimization.}

Accuracy and speed are primary factors in choosing a causal inference method, as they determine which hypotheses can be tested, how much of the search space can be explored, and what decisions can be made based on the results. In this work we present a new causal inference framework that 1) improves the accuracy of inferences in time series data, and 2) enables faster computation of causal significance. Instead of evaluating relationships individually, using only features of the data, this approach exploits the connections between each causal relationship's relative levels of significance. We provide theoretical guarantees of correctness and speed (with an order of magnitude improvement) and empirically demonstrate improved FDR, FNR, and computation speed relative to leading approaches.}

To address the issues that the traditional approaches either rely on expert knowledge and handcrafted features or do not fully model long-term dependencies hidden in time-domain signals, this work presents a novel fault diagnosis framework based on an end-to-end Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model, to learn features directly from multivariate time-series data and capture long-term dependencies through recurrent behaviour and gates mechanism of LSTM. Experimental results on two wind turbine datasets show that our method is able to do fault classification effectively from raw time-series signals collected by single or multiple sensors and outperforms state-of-art approaches. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed framework is validated through the experiments on small dataset with limited data.}

We use a high spatial and temporal resolution power system optimisation model to explore the conditions that lead to the deployment of floating offshore wind and the effect this has on the rest of the electricity system for Great Britain in 2050. We perform a sensitivity analysis on three dimensions: total share of renewables, floating offshore costs and the impact of waves on operation. We find that all three impact the deployment of floating offshore wind energy. A clear competition between floating offshore wind and conventional offshore wind is demonstrated, with less impact on other renewable sources. It is shown that floating wind is used to provide access to greater spatial diversification. Further, access to more distant regions also affects the optimal placement of conventional offshore wind, as spatial diversification is spread between floating and bottom-mounted sites.}

	abstract     = {The present study aims at assessing the ideal power curve of fixed-speed, passive stall, small horizontal axis wind turbines from turbulent field data. The ideal power curve refers to ideal conditions (e.g., the wind is steady, laminar, spatially uniform and undisturbed by the turbine; no yaw error; the power output is intended in steady state). The ideal power curve has two main applications: the prediction of the wind energy that can be captured and the extension of the power curve to sites having different turbulence levels from the primitive test site. A 12kW fixed-speed wind turbine was monitored for two years in a fairly turbulent site; the power train of the turbine had no appreciable filtering effect on the wind fluctuations. The ideal power curve was analytically derived by a Taylor's expansion (whose convergence was enhanced by the Shanks' transformation) and by an accurate analytical assumption of the ideal power coefficient. The present analytical solution is easy to handle and compared successfully to the IEC-based curve. The turbulence increases/diminishes the power output for velocities less/greater than the velocity at the inflection point of the power curve. Energy predictions by the ideal curve are within the inherent experimental error.}

Though many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, they are rather ad-hoc in nature and difficult to extend and integrate with other techniques. In this paper, we tackle the problem in a formal way to provide a strong foundation for supporting large models. We propose a method of formally rewriting the computational graph of a model where swap-out and swap-in operations are inserted to temporarily store intermediate results on CPU memory. By introducing a categorized topological ordering for simulating graph execution, the memory consumption of a model can be easily analyzed by using operation distances in the ordering. As a result, the problem of fitting a large model into a memory-limited accelerator is reduced to the problem of reducing operation distances in a categorized topological ordering. We then show how to formally derive swap-out and swap-in operations from an existing graph and present rules to optimize the graph. Finally, we propose a simulation-based auto-tuning to automatically find suitable graph-rewriting parameters for the best performance. We developed a module in TensorFlow, called LMS, by which we successfully trained ResNet-50 with a 4.9x larger mini-batch size and 3D U-Net with a 5.6x larger image resolution.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2019 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management}, pages = {1–13}, numpages = {13}, keywords = {computational graphs, simulator, large neural models, GPU memory}, location = {Phoenix, AZ, USA}, series = {ISMM 2019} }

abstract = "Recently, due to the availability of big data and the rapid growth of computing power, artificial intelligence (AI) has regained tremendous attention and investment. Machine learning (ML) approaches have been successfully applied to solve many problems in academia and in industry. Although the explosion of big data applications is driving the development of ML, it also imposes severe challenges of data processing speed and scalability on conventional computer systems. Computing platforms that are dedicatedly designed for AI applications have been considered, ranging from a complement to von Neumann platforms to a “must-have” and stand-alone technical solution. These platforms, which belong to a larger category named “domain-specific computing,” focus on specific customization for AI. In this article, we focus on summarizing the recent advances in accelerator designs for deep neural networks (DNNs)—that is, DNN accelerators. We discuss various architectures that support DNN executions in terms of computing units, dataflow optimization, targeted network topologies, architectures on emerging technologies, and accelerators for emerging applications. We also provide our visions on the future trend of AI chip designs."

However, the extremely high memory requirements for them make it difficult to run the training processes on single many-core architectures such as a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), which compels researchers to use model parallelism over multiple GPUs to make it work. However, model parallelism always brings very heavy additional overhead. Therefore, running an extreme-scale model in a single GPU is urgently required. There still exist several challenges to reduce the memory footprint for extreme-scale deep learning. To address this tough problem, we first identify the memory usage characteristics for deep and wide convolutional networks, and demonstrate the opportunities for memory reuse at both the intra-layer and inter-layer levels. We then present Layrub, a runtime data placement strategy that orchestrates the execution of the training process. It achieves layer-centric reuse to reduce memory consumption for extreme-scale deep learning that could not previously be run on a single GPU. Experiments show that, compared to the original Caffe, Layrub can cut down the memory usage rate by an average of 58.2% and by up to 98.9%, at the moderate cost of 24.1% higher training execution time on average. Results also show that Layrub outperforms some popular deep learning systems such as GeePS, vDNN, MXNet, and Tensorflow. More importantly, Layrub can tackle extreme-scale deep learning tasks. For example, it makes an extra-deep ResNet with 1,517 layers that can be trained successfully in one GPU with 12GB memory, while other existing deep learning systems cannot.}, journal = {ACM Trans.

abstract = "Accurate wind power forecasting is essential for efficient operation and maintenance (O&M) of wind power conversion systems. Offshore wind power predictions are even more challenging due to the multifaceted systems and the harsh environment in which they are operating. In some scenarios, data from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are used for modern wind turbine power forecasting. In this study, a deep learning neural network was constructed to predict wind power based on a very high-frequency SCADA database with a sampling rate of 1-s. Input features were engineered based on the physical process of offshore wind turbines, while their linear and non-linear correlations were further investigated through Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients and the deep learning algorithm, respectively. Initially, eleven features were used in the predictive model, which are four wind speeds at different heights, three measured pitch angles of each blade, average blade pitch angle, nacelle orientation, yaw error, and ambient temperature. A comparison between different features shown that nacelle orientation, yaw error, and ambient temperature can be reduced in the deep learning model. The simulation results showed that the proposed approach can reduce the computational cost and time in wind power forecasting while retaining high accuracy."

Yet the growing number of RES impede the necessary effort to control the system. The introduction of digital or smart energy systems is often proclaimed as a logical next step towards coping with this rising complexity. It seems convenient that the manufacturing industry, as one of the major energy consumers, is currently also in a process of a digital transition, the fourth industrial revolution. This paper explores the current state of expert discourse on the role of a digitized industry as a potential enabler for the energy transition using Germany as a case study. For this purpose, we gathered qualitative data through semistructured interviews among industry managers and energy researchers. We identified the three major areas in the expert discourse of industry's future potentials: (1) increasing transparency in the energy system, (2) providing demand flexibility, and (3) increasing energy efficiency. In this paper, we address the internal barriers and explore industry's reluctance to interact with the energy system in order to initiate a transition.}

To achieve anomaly detection and fault analysis of wind turbine components, this paper proposes a deep learning method based on a deep auto-encoder (DAE) network using operational supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data of wind turbines. First, a component DAE network model using multiple restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) was constructed. Previously collected normal SCADA data from wind turbines were used to train this multilayer network model layer-wise to extract the relationships between SCADA variables. Then, a reconstruction error (Re) was calculated by using the DAE network input and its output reconstruction value, which was defined as the condition detection index to reflect the component health condition. Due to the acute changes and disturbances of wind speed in actual operation, the calculated detection index always has an extreme distribution that can cause false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive threshold determined by the extreme value theory was proposed and used as the rule of anomaly judgement. The method can not only implement early warning of fault components but also deduce the physical location of a faulted component by DAE residuals. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by some reported failure cases of wind turbine components.}

ABSTRACT = {Wind power generation has been the fastest-growing energy alternative in recent years, however, it still has to compete with cheaper fossil energy sources. This is one of the motivations to constantly improve the efficiency of wind turbines and develop new Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) methodologies. The decisions regarding O&amp;M are based on different types of models, which cover a wide range of scenarios and variables and share the same goal, which is to minimize the Cost of Energy (COE) and maximize the profitability of a wind farm (WF). In this context, this review aims to identify and classify, from a comprehensive perspective, the different types of models used at the strategic, tactical, and operational decision levels of wind turbine maintenance, emphasizing mathematical models (MatMs). The investigation allows the conclusion that even though the evolution of the models and methodologies is ongoing, decision making in all the areas of the wind industry is currently based on artificial intelligence and machine learning models.},

	abstract     = {Wind turbines are mainly located in harsh environment, and the maintenance is therefore very difficult. The wind turbine faults are mostly from the gear box, and the fault signal is generally nonlinear and nonstationary. The traditional fault diagnosis methods such as Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and the inverted frequency spectrum identification method based on FFT are not satisfactory in processing this kind of signal. This paper proposes a hybrid fault diagnosis method which combines the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and wavelet transform. The vibration signal is analyzed through wavelet transform, and the aliasing in high-frequency signals is then addressed by conducting EMD to the original signals. The experimental results based on a specific wind turbine gear box demonstrate that this method can diagnose the faults and locate their positions accurately.}

Considering the spectral complexity of planetary gearbox vibration signals as well as their amplitude modulation and frequency modulation (AMFM) nature, we propose a simple yet effective method to diagnose planetary gearbox faults based on amplitude and frequency demodulations. We use the energy separation algorithm to estimate the amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency of modulated signals for further demodulation analysis, by exploiting the adaptability of Teager energy operator to instantaneous changes in signals and the fine time resolution. However, the energy separation algorithm requires signals to be mono-components. To satisfy this requirement, we decompose signals into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method as it can decompose any signal into mono-components. We further propose a criterion to guide the selection of the most relevant IMF for demodulation analysis according to the wavelet-like filter nature of EEMD and the AMFM characteristics of the planetary gearbox vibration signals. By matching the dominant peaks in the Fourier spectra of the obtained amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency with the theoretical characteristic frequency of each gear, we can diagnose planetary gearbox faults. The principle and effectiveness of the proposed method are illustrated by simulation and the experimental analysis of signals from a planetary gearbox of a wind turbine test rig. With the proposed method, both the wear and chipping faults can be detected and located for a sun gear of the planetary gearbox test rig.}

Due to mentioned non-stationary load/speed conditions, signal processing and decision making for bearings diagnostics is still challenging issue. As a data source a professional monitoring system is used. Two kind of information have been acquired: RMS of vibration acceleration signal and generator power that is related to the operating conditions. The received data cover the period of several months, when the bearing has changed its condition significantly. Due to considerable variability of the mentioned data, an embedded decision making regarding the condition of bearings is difficult. The novel method proposed in the paper is based on statistical feature processing instead of just simple comparison of the value of the feature with threshold that is used in the system. Statistical data processing is done in two dimensional feature-load space in several sub-ranges of operating conditions. It has been found that for different load ranges behavior of data and effectiveness of bad-good data separation ability is different. Decomposition of data in several load sub-ranges has provided better recognition efficiency than for all data taken together.}

Although automated workflows that integrate these software tools into an organized data flow are emerging, in this paper we propose a unique open-source tool, designed by the authors, called bibliometrix, for performing comprehensive science mapping analysis. bibliometrix supports a recommended workflow to perform bibliometric analyses. As it is programmed in R, the proposed tool is flexible and can be rapidly upgraded and integrated with other statistical R-packages.

Following a systematic method of literature review, we have established 4 research questions and 37 scientific articles that answer the said questions.

abstract = {Abstract The last decade has witnessed an increased interest in applying machine learning techniques to predict faults and anomalies in the operation of wind turbines. These efforts have lately been dominated by deep learning techniques which, as in other fields, tend to outperform traditional machine learning algorithms given sufficient amounts of training data. An important shortcoming of deep learning models is their lack of transparency—they operate as black boxes and typically do not provide rationales for their predictions, which can lead to a lack of trust in predicted outputs. In this article, a novel hybrid model for anomaly prediction in wind farms is proposed, which combines a recurrent neural network approach for accurate classification with an XGBoost decision tree classifier for transparent outputs. Experiments with an offshore wind turbine show that our model achieves a classification accuracy of up to 97\%. The model is further able to generate detailed feature importance analyses for any detected anomalies, identifying exactly those components in a wind turbine that contribute to an anomaly. Finally, the feasibility of transfer learning is demonstrated for the wind domain by porting our “offshore” model to an unseen dataset from an onshore wind farm. The latter model achieves an accuracy of 65\% and is able to detect 85\% of anomalies in the unseen domain. These results are encouraging for application to wind farms for which no training data are available, for example, because they have not been in operation for long.},

	abstract     = {Wind farms are enormous and complex control systems. It is challenging and valuable to control and optimize wind farms. Their applications are widely used in various industries. Artificial intelligent algorithms are effective methods for optimization problems due to their distinctive characteristics. They have been successfully applied to wind farms. In this paper, several issues in wind farms are presented. Applications of artificial intelligent algorithms in wind farm controllers, Mach number, wind speed prediction, wind power prediction and other problems of wind farms are reviewed. Two future research directions are pointed out to develop artificial intelligent algorithms for wind farm control systems and wind speed and power prediction.},

	abstract     = {This paper reviews the recent literature on machine learning (ML) models that have been used for condition monitoring in wind turbines (e.g. blade fault detection or generator temperature monitoring). We classify these models by typical ML steps, including data sources, feature selection and extraction, model selection (classification, regression), validation and decision-making. Our findings show that most models use SCADA or simulated data, with almost two-thirds of methods using classification and the rest relying on regression. Neural networks, support vector machines and decision trees are most commonly used. We conclude with a discussion of the main areas for future work in this domain.}
