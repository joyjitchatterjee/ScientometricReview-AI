TI New oil condition monitoring system, Wearsens((R)) enables continuous,
   online detection of critical operating conditions and wear damage
SO JURNAL TRIBOLOGI
LA English
DT Article
DE Oil sensor system; Online condition monitoring; Preventive maintenance
AB A new oil sensor system is presented for the continuous, online measurement of the wear in turbines, industrial gears, generators, hydraulic systems and transformers. Detection of change is much earlier than existing technologies such as particle counting, vibration measurement or recording temperature. Thus targeted, corrective procedures and/or maintenance can be carried out before actual damage occurs. Efficient machine utilization, accurately timed preventive maintenance, increased service life and a reduction of downtime can all be achieved. The presented sensor system effectively controls the proper operation conditions of bearings and cogwheels in gears. The online diagnostics system measures components of the specific complex impedance of oils. For instance, metal abrasion due to wear debris, broken oil molecules, forming acids or oil soaps, result in an increase of the electrical conductivity, which directly correlates with the degree of contamination of the oil. For additivated lubricants, the stage of degradation of the additives can also be derived from changes in the dielectric constant. The determination of impurities or reduction in the quality of the oil and the quasi continuous evaluation of wear and chemical aging follow the holistic approach of a real-time monitoring of an alteration in the condition of the oil-machine system. Once the oil condition monitoring sensors are installed on the wind turbine, industrial gearbox and test stands, the measuring data can be displayed and evaluated elsewhere. The signals are transmitted to a web-based condition monitoring system via LAN, WLAN or serial interfaces of the sensor unit. Monitoring of the damage mechanisms during proper operation below the tolerance limits of the components enables specific preventive maintenance independent of rigid inspection intervals.

AB This paper deals with the condition monitoring of wind turbine gearboxes under varying operating conditions. Generally, gearbox systems include nonlinearities so a simplified nonlinear gear model is developed, on which the time-frequency analysis method proposed is first applied for the easiest understanding of the challenges faced. The effect of varying loads is examined in the simulations and later on in real wind turbine gearbox experimental data. The Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method is used to decompose the vibration signals into meaningful signal components associated with specific frequency bands of the signal. The mode mixing problem of the EMD is examined in the simulation part and the results in that part of the paper suggest that further research might be of interest in condition monitoring terms. For the amplitude-frequency demodulation of the signal components produced, the Hilbert Transform (HT) is used as a standard method. In addition, the Teager-Kaiser energy operator (TKEO), combined with an energy separation algorithm, is a recent alternative method, the performance of which is tested in the paper too. The results show that the WED approach is a promising alternative to the HT, since it can improve the estimation of the instantaneous spectral characteristics of the vibration data under certain conditions.

AB The use of condition monitoring systems on offshore wind turbines has increased dramatically in recent times. However, their use is mostly restricted to vibration based monitoring systems for the gearbox, generator and drive train. A survey of commercially available condition monitoring systems and their associated costs has been completed for the blades, drive train, tower and foundation. This paper considers what value can be obtained from integrating these additional systems into the maintenance plan. This is achieved by running simulations on an operations and maintenance model for a wind farm over a 20 year life cycle. The model uses Hidden Markov Models to represent both the actual system state and the observed condition monitoring state. The CM systems are modelled to include reduced failure types, false alarms, detection rates and 6 month failure warnings. The costs for system failures are derived, as are possible reductions in costs due to early detection. The detection capabilities of the CM systems are investigated and the effects on operational costs are examined. Likewise, the number of failures detected 6 months in advance by the CM systems is modified and the costs reported.

ID TIME-SERIES; EQUATIONS; LAYER
AB Based on the Langevin equation, it has been proposed to obtain power curves for wind turbines from high-frequency data of wind speed measurements u(t) and power output P(t). The two parts of the Langevin approach, power curve and drift field, give a comprehensive description of the conversion dynamic over the whole operating range of the wind turbine. The method deals with high- frequent data instead of 10min means. It is therefore possible to gain a reliable power curve already from a small amount of data per wind speed. Furthermore, the method is able to visualize multiple fixed points, which is, e.g. characteristic for the transition from partial to full load or in case the conversion process deviates from the standard procedures. In order to gain a deeper knowledge, it is essential that the method works not only for measured data but also for numerical wind turbine models and synthetic wind fields. Here, we characterize the dynamics of a detailed numerical wind turbine model and calculate the Langevin power curve for different data samplings. We show how to obtain reliable results from synthetic data and verify the applicability of the method for field measurements with ultra-sonic, cup, and Lidar measurements. The independence of the fixed points on site- specific turbulence effects is also confirmed with the numerical model. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of the Langevin approach to detect failures in the conversion process and thus show the potential of the Langevin approach for a condition monitoring system.

AB This paper presents a discussion of the development of wind energy generation in the United Kingdom and the challenges faced by the wind industry including reliability, performance and condition monitoring, particularly in the offshore environment. The worldwide installed capacity of offshore wind has now risen to over 7GW, with an ever increasing deployment rate of new assets. About 90% of the global currently installed capacity is in Northern Europe, with the United Kingdom having the world's largest share at 4GW. Capacity factor data from UK offshore wind farms is presented, providing an insight into the current performance of large Round 2 offshore wind farms compared to the earlier Round 1 farms and to onshore farms. The data reveal that the United Kingdom's Round 2 offshore farms are achieving an average monthly capacity factor of 38.3% with a peak value of 75.8%. The older Round 1 farms have a lower average capacity factor of 33.6% while large onshore farms with capacities above 100 MW have achieved 25.6%. Offshore wind turbine performance has improved over time, and the industry is applying the learning from early experiences to achieve better performances at the more recently installed farms. Despite these improvements in turbine availability, the cost of energy from wind, particularly offshore, remains too high for it to be a commercially viable form of generation without subsidies. Reducing the cost of energy from wind to economically sustainable levels is the most important challenge facing the industry today. Operation and maintenance costs constitute up to 30 % of the total cost of energy from wind in large farms. The industry must overcome the challenges associated with improving component reliability and the development and adoption by operators of appropriate condition monitoring systems and maintenance strategies, in order to reduce costs to sustainable levels. Research and development work carried out with these goals in mind is also reviewed in the paper.

AB Planetary gearboxes (PGBs) are widely used in the drivetrain of wind turbines. Any PGB failure could lead to breakdown of the whole drivetrain and major loss of wind turbines. Therefore, PGB fault diagnosis is important in reducing the downtime and maintenance cost and improving the reliability and lifespan of wind turbines. PGB fault diagnosis has been done mostly through vibration analysis over the past years. Vibration signals theoretically have an amplitude modulation (AM) effect caused by time-variant vibration transfer paths due to the rotation of planet carrier and sun gear, and therefore, their spectral structure is complex. Strain sensor signals, on the other hand, are closely correlated to torsional vibration, which is less sensitive to the AM effect caused by rotating vibration transfer path. Thus, it is potentially easy and effective to diagnose PGB faults via stain sensor signal analysis. In this paper, a new method using a single piezoelectric strain sensor for PGB fault diagnosis is presented. The method is validated on a set of seeded localized faults on all gears, namely, sun gear, planetary gear, and ring gear. The validation results have shown a satisfactory PGB fault diagnostic performance using strain sensor signal analysis.

AB Incipient defects occurring in long wind turbine (WT) blades are difficult to detect using the existing condition monitoring (CM) techniques. To tackle this issue, a new WT blade CM method is studied in this paper with the aid of the concept of transmissibility of frequency response functions. Different from the existing CM techniques that judge the health condition of a blade by interpreting individual CM signals, the proposed method jointly utilizes the CM signals measured by a number of neighboring sensors. This offers the proposed technique a unique capability of both damage detection and location. The proposed technique has been experimentally verified by using the real CM data collected during the fatigue and static tests of a full-scale WT blade. The experiment has shown that the new technique is effective not only in damage detection but also in damage location when either fiber Bragg grating strain gauges or accelerometers are used for data acquisition.

TI Wind Turbine Condition Monitoring Based on an Improved Spline-Kernelled

DE Chirplet transform (CT); condition monitoring (CM); wind turbine (WT)
ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; POWER; TIME
AB The time-varying operational conditions applied to wind turbines (WTs) not only challenge their operation but also make condition monitoring (CM) difficult. To achieve a reliable CM result, more advanced signal processing techniques, rather than the conventional spectral analyses, are urgently needed for interpreting the nonlinear and nonstationary (NNS) CM signals collected from the turbines. The work presented in this paper is an effort to meet such a requirement. Based on the proven capability of the spline-kernelled chirplet transform(SCT) in detecting the instantaneous frequencies within NNS monocomponent signals, this paper improves the SCT to enable it to detect the instantaneous amplitude of lengthy NNS multicomponent signals at a fault-related frequency of interest. The improved SCT is then applied for developing a new real-time CM technique dedicated to extracting fault-related features from WT CM signals. Experiment proves that the improved SCT has overcome existing SCT issues and is capable of correctly tracking the amplitude characteristics of NNS multicomponent signals at fault-related frequencies of interest. The new CM technique developed, based on this improved SCT, shows success in detecting both mechanical and electrical faults occurring in a WT drive train, despite the constantly varying operational conditions of the turbine. Moreover, its algorithm is efficient in computation, which not only enables it to deal with lengthy NNS CM signals but also makes it ideal for online use.

AB The installation of a condition monitoring system (CMS) aims to reduce the operating costs of the monitored system by applying a predictive maintenance strategy. However, a system-driven configuration of the CMS requires the knowledge of the system kinematics and could induce a lot of false alarms because of predefined thresholds. The purpose of this paper is to propose a complete data-driven method to automatically generate system health indicators without any a priori on the monitored system or the acquired signals. This method is composed of two steps. First, every acquired signal is analyzed: the spectral peaks are detected and then grouped in a more complex structure as harmonic series or modulation sidebands. Then, a time-frequency tracking operation is applied on all available signals: the spectral peaks and the spectral structures are tracked over time and grouped in trajectories, which will be used to generate the system health indicators. The proposed method is tested on real-world signals coming from a wind turbine test rig. The detection of a harmonic series and a modulation sideband reports the birth of a fault on the main bearing inner ring. The evolution of the fault severity is characterized by three automatically generated health indicators and is confirmed by experts.

TI Economic evaluation of maintenance strategies for wind turbines: a
   stochastic analysis
SO IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The authors develop a stochastic model for assessing the life-cycle cost and availability of wind turbines resulting from different maintenance scenarios, with the objective to identify the most cost-effective maintenance strategy. Using field-data-based reliability models, the wind turbine - in terms of reliability - is modelled as a serial connection of the most critical components. Both direct cost for spare parts, labour and access to the turbine, as well as indirect cost from production losses are explicitly taken into account. The model is applied to the case of a Vestas V44-600 kW wind turbine. Results of a reliability-centred maintenance analysis of this wind turbine are used to select the most critical wind turbine components and to identify possible maintenance scenarios. This study reveals that corrective maintenance is the most cost-effective maintenance strategy for the gearbox and the generator of the V44 turbine, while the cost benefit of condition-based maintenance using online condition-monitoring systems increases with higher electricity price, turbine capacity and remoteness of sites.

TI Wind Turbine Blade Life-Time Assessment Model for Preventive Planning of
   Operation and Maintenance
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE maintenance; blades; degradation; fracture mechanics; offshore
AB Out of the total wind turbine failure events, blade damage accounts for a substantial part, with some studies estimating it at around 23%. Current operation and maintenance (O&M) practices typically make use of corrective type maintenance as the basic approach, implying high costs for repair and replacement activities as well as large revenue losses, mainly in the case of offshore wind farms. The recent development and evolution of condition monitoring techniques, as well as the fact that an increasing number of installed turbines are equipped with online monitoring systems, offers a large amount of information on the blades structural health to the decision maker. Further, inspections of the blades are often performed in connection with service. In light of the obtained information, a preventive type of maintenance becomes feasible, with the potential of predicting the blades remaining life to support O&M decisions for avoiding major failure events. The present paper presents a fracture mechanics based model for estimating the remaining life of a wind turbine blade, focusing on the crack propagation in the blades adhesive joints. A generic crack propagation model is built in Matlab based on a Paris law approach. The model is used within a risk-based maintenance decision framework to optimize maintenance planning for the blades lifetime.

TI Micro-Siting of Wind Turbine in Complex Terrain: Simplified Fatigue Life
   Prediction of Main Bearing in Direct Drive Wind Turbines
SO WIND ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION
AB In Japan, 1,516 wind turbine accidents have been recorded between year 2004 and 2012, and 84% of them were for turbines in complex terrains. The longest downtime was associated with damage to main shafts or bearings with an average downtime of 5.7 months. Careful micro-siting in complex terrains can prevent these accidents from happening. The objective of the paper is to provide an intermediate step that allows consultants, developers, and wind farm owners to further evaluate micro-siting of wind turbines in complex terrains, prior to load simulations by manufacturers. The author developed a simplified method to predict fatigue life of a main rear bearing in direct drive wind turbines. The method uses hub-height 10 minutes wind data as an input. The validation with an actual accident showed practically good agreement of 12.0 years of the predicted life against 12.7 years of the actual life. The method was also applied to quantify the effect of a curtailment. The proposed curtailment increased the predicted life to 35.5 years with a relatively small range of wind speed at a direction of only 1 % frequency distribution. With the proposed method, it is possible to layout turbines where fatigue life of a main rear bearing is longer than its design life. The method can also be applied to existing turbines in order to spot turbines that require careful maintenance, and to consider an installation of condition monitoring system on a bearing.

ID FAULT-DETECTION; OPTIMIZATION
AB Wind Turbines require numerous and varied types of maintenance activities throughout their lifespan, the frequency of which increases with years in operation. At present the proportion of maintenance cost to the total cost for wind turbines is significant particularly for offshore wind turbines (OWT) where this ratio is approximate to 35%. If this ratio is to be reduced in-spite of adverse operating conditions, pre-mature component failures and absence of reliability database for wind turbine components, there is a need to design unconventional maintenance scheme preferably by including novel failure prediction methodologies. Several researchers have advocated the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Bayesian Network Theory (BNT) and other statistical methods to predict failure so as to plan efficient maintenance of wind turbines, however novelty and randomness of failures, nature and number of parameters involved in statistical calculations and absence of required amount of fundamental work required for such advanced analysis have continued to maintain the high cost of maintenance. This work builds upon the benefits of condition monitoring to design methods to predict generic failures in wind turbine components and exhibits how such prediction methods can assist in cutting the maintenance cost of wind turbines. This study proposes using a dedicated tool to assist with failure prediction and planning and execution of wind turbine maintenance. The design and development of such an all-inclusive tool will assist in performing administrative works, inventory control, financial calculations and service management apart from failure prediction in wind turbine components. Its database will contain reference to standard management practices, regulatory provisions, staff details and their skillsets, service call register, troubleshooting manuals, installation guide, service history, details of customers and clients etc. that would cater to multiple avenues of wind turbine maintenance. In order to build such a software package, a robust design of its database is crucial. This work lists prerequisites for choosing a physical database and identifies the benefits of relational database software in controlling large amounts of data of various formats that are stored in such physical databases. Such a database would be an invaluable resource for reliability studies, an area of interest for both academic researchers and the industry that are identifying avenues to economise wind turbine operations.

Thanks to data-driven signal processing algorithms, the proposed solution is fully automatic for the user. The paper briefly describes all the steps of the processing, from preprocessing of the acquired signal to interpretation of the generated results. It starts with an angular resampling method with speed measurement correction. Then comes a data validation step, in both the time/angular and frequency/order domains. After the preprocessing, the spectral components of the analysed signal are identified and classified into several classes, from sine wave to narrowband components. This spectral peak detection and classification allows the harmonic and side-band series to be extracted, which may be part of the signal spectral content. Moreover, the detected spectral patterns are associated with the characteristic frequencies of the investigated system. Based on the detected side-band series, the full-band demodulation is performed. At each step, the diagnosis features are computed and dynamically tracked, signal by signal. Finally, system health indicators are proposed to conclude the condition of the investigated system. All the steps mentioned create a self-sufficient tool for a robust diagnosis of mechanical faults. The paper presents the performance of the proposed method on real-world signals from a wind turbine drivetrain.

ID CURVES
AB A power performance assessment technique is developed for the detection of power production discrepancies in wind turbines. The method employs a widely used nonparametric pattern recognition technique, the kernel methods. The evaluation is based on the trending of an extracted feature from the kernel matrix, called similarity index, which is introduced by the authors for the first time. The operation of the turbine and consequently the computation of the similarity indexes is classified into five power bins offering better resolution and thus more consistent root cause analysis. The accurate and proper detection of power production changes is demonstrated in cases of icing, power derating, operation under noise reduction mode, and incorrect controller input signal. Finally, overviews are illustrated for parks subjected to icing and operating under limited rotational speed. The comparison between multiple adjacent turbines contributes further to the correct evaluation of the park overall performance.

AB As the capacity of wind turbines has increased, the loads on crucial components such as a gearbox, a generator, and blades are significantly increasing. An intelligent online monitoring system is indispensable to protect the excessive load on core components and manage a wind farm efficiently. In order to verify new online monitoring and diagnostic methods for such a monitoring system in advance, a wind turbine simulator is essential. For this purpose, we developed a simulator that has similar dynamics to an actual 3 MW wind turbine, and is thereby able to acquire a state of operation that closely resembles that of the 3 MW wind turbine under a variety of wind conditions.
   This paper describes the implementation of a torque and a collective pitch controller, which is used for a new type of simulator with the intention of exploiting online monitoring and diagnostic methods. The torque and the collective pitch controllers were developed to facilitate variable speed-variable pitch control strategies in the wind turbine simulator. Experiments demonstrated that three control regions were successfully deployed on the simulator, and thereby the simulator was operated at all control regions in a stable and accurate manner. Moreover, the strain and vibration measured from the blade and the gearbox showed different trends at three control regions. Therefore, a new type of simulator is an effective means to develop diagnostic and prognostic algorithms as well as online monitoring methods reflecting the dependency of dynamic characteristics on the control regions.

AB To simplify signal analysis on wind turbine blades and enable their efficient monitoring, this paper presents a novel method of transforming blade moment signals on a horizontal axis 3-blade wind turbine. Instead of processing 3-blade moment signals directly, the proposed algorithm transforms the three sinusoidal signals into two static signals relative to the center of blade rotation through vector synthesis and coordinate transformation, and eliminates frequency components due to blade rotation from the obtained signals. Moreover, as an alternative to a rotational sensor, a blade rotation angle estimator is introduced. Its effectiveness was confirmed through simulations and field tests on an actual wind turbine.

AB Wind turbines are an energy conversion system having a low density on the territory, and therefore needing accurate condition monitoring in the operative phase. Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) control systems have become ubiquitous in wind energy technology and they pose the challenge of extracting from them simple and explanatory information on goodness of operation and performance. In the present work, post processing methods are applied on the SCADA measurements of two onshore wind farms sited in southern Italy. Innovative and meaningful indicators of goodness of performance are formulated. The philosophy is a climax in the granularity of the analysis: first, Malfunctioning Indexes are proposed, which quantify goodness of merely operational behavior of the machine, irrespective of the quality of output. Subsequently the focus is shifted to the analysis of the farms in the productive phase: dependency of farm efficiency on wind direction is investigated through the polar plot, which is revisited in a novel way in order to make it consistent for onshore wind farms. Finally, the inability of the nacelle to optimally follow meandering wind due to wakes is analysed through a Stationarity Index and a Misalignment Index, which are shown to capture the relation between mechanical behavior of the turbine and degradation of the power output.

AB A new diagnostic method is proposed to efficiently monitor the structural health and detect damages in wind turbine blades. A high-resolution real-time blade condition monitoring system that considers the harsh turbine operating environment and uses optical sensors and a wireless network is presented. A hybrid algorithm, which merges probabilistic analysis, design loads, and real-time load estimates, is introduced to enhance operational safety and reliability. Moreover, the alarm limits are updated every 10 min through a learning algorithm to further improve reliability. The proposed algorithm was implemented in a blade monitoring system. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated for a 3-MW wind turbine in the Yeongheung wind farm.

DE E-maintenance; RCM; Wind turbines; Gearboxes; Oil analysis
AB Renewable energy sources such as wind energy are available without any limitations. In order to extract this energy efficiency, the reliability of such technologies is critical if pay back periods and power generation requirements are to be met. Due to recent developments in the field of wind engineering and in particular the expansion of installed capacity around the world, the need for reliable and intelligent diagnostic tools is of greater importance. The number of offshore wind turbines installed in the seas around Britain's coasts is likely to increase from just fewer than 150-7,500 over the next 10 years with the potential cost of 10 pound billion. Operation and Maintenance activities are estimated to be 35 % against the cost of electricity. However, the development of appropriate and efficient maintenance strategies is currently lacking in the wind industry. The current reliability and failure modes of offshore wind turbines are known and have been used to develop preventive and corrective maintenance strategies which have done little to improve reliability. In addition, the failure of one minor component can cause escalated damage to a major component, which can increase repair and or replacement costs. A reliability centered maintenance (RCM) approach offers considerable benefit to the management of wind turbine operations since it includes an appreciation of the impact of faults on operations. Due to the high costs involved in performing maintenance and the even higher costs associated with failures and subsequent downtime and repair, it is critical that the impacts are considered when maintenance is planned. This paper provides an overview of the application of RCM and on line e-condition monitoring to wind turbine maintenance management. Unplanned maintenance levels can be reduced by increasing the reliability of the gear box and individual gears through the analysis of lubricants. Finally the paper will discuss the development of a complete sensor-based processing unit that can continuously monitor the wind turbines lubricated systems and provide, via wireless technology, real time data enabling on shore staff with the ability to predict degradation anticipate problems and take remedial action before damage and failure occurs.

ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS
AB Modern condition monitoring systems (CMS) collect and process enormous amount of data in order to provide the earliest and most dependable information of fault development within any of the machine components and their operation combined. According to numerous studies one of the most fault susceptible mechanical elements in rotating machinery are rolling element bearings. Although reliable techniques for their diagnostics are already proposed, the new investigation is needed. According to authors experience in many industrial applications the operators are obligated to simultaneously track hundreds of diagnostic estimates, such as signals energy, its peakedness or narrowband characteristics for localized faults. As mentioned, for a vibration-based CMS of single wind turbine there are nearly 150 of them. Therefore, the authors employ a fuzzy logic approach for integration of bearing diagnostic features. A new estimate that carry most relevant information about bearing condition is discussed. The reasoning is presented on simulated data that mimics real rotating machine.

ID OIL
AB A relatively recent development for the condition monitoring of oil-wetted machinery has been the in-line full-flow inductive wear debris sensor (hereafter referred to as inductive wear debris sensors). These sensors detect a disturbance to a magnetic field caused by metallic wear debris shed from deteriorating dynamic components that is entrained in the lubricant. Applications for these sensors currently include (but are not limited to) aviation machinery, wind-turbine generators, marine propulsion systems, and locomotives. Inductive wear debris sensors can distinguish between ferromagnetic and nonferromagnetic particles as well as providing size and other related information. One of the primary advantages of this sensor type is that the detectable size range is broad and may be used to track the progress of an incipient failure such as the rolling contact fatigue of a bearing or gear as it occurs. One aspect that has received little attention in the literature is the methodology for determining a suitable limit for a particular application. Limits are a critically important aspect of machinery condition monitoring and need to be established by a robust and reliable method otherwise unnecessary maintenance can occur or an incipient fault may be missed. This paper describes a generic method for determining a physically meaningful debris limit for a deteriorating rolling element bearing when utilizing an inductive wear debris sensor.

AB The widespread deployment of industrial wind projects will require a more proactive maintenance strategy in order to be more cost competitive. This paper describes an ongoing research project on developing online lubrication oil condition monitoring and degradation detection tools using commercially available online sensors. In particular, an investigation on particle contamination of lubrication oil is reported. Methods are presented for online lubrication oil condition monitoring and remaining useful life prediction using viscosity and dielectric constant sensors along with particle filtering technique. Physical models are derived in order to establish the mathematical relationship between lubrication oil degradation and particle contamination level. Laboratory experiments are performed to validate the accuracy of the developed models by comparing viscosity and dielectric constant sensor outputs of different particle concentration levels with those simulated by the lubricant deterioration physical models. A case study on lubrication oil degradation detection and remaining useful life prediction is provided. Discussions on the potential for extrapolating the presented methods to typical wind turbine gearbox oil and the practical implementation of particle filter-based approach for online wind turbine gearbox oil remaining useful life prediction are also included.

AB Gearbox transmission system is the major part of the wind turbine drive train. Due to the manufacturing and assembling errors, lubrication condition, wear and uncertainties in material and geometric properties, the system parameters, including mesh stiffness, transmission error and damping of the meshing gears are always uncertain. For a more reasonable evaluation of dynamic characteristics of the gearbox transmission system, the influence of the uncertain parameters should be taken into consideration. Based on the Chebyshev interval method (CIM), the dynamic responses of a geared transmission system with uncertain parameters are thus investigated in this paper. A torsional vibration model is derived for a geared system, in which some parameters including the mesh stiffness, the transmission error, the mesh damping, the shaft damping, the moment of inertia of the input blades and the torsional stiffness of the driving coupling shaft are considered as uncertain but bounded parameters. Interval dynamic equations of the geared system are solved by use of the CIM in combination with the variable-step Runge-Kutta numerical integration method. The accuracy of the CIM is demonstrated in comparison with the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Variations of the upper and lower bounds of the dynamic mesh force with input speed are obtained. The effects of those uncertain parameters on the frequency response of the dynamic mesh force are discussed in detail. It is shown that small parameter uncertainties might be propagated in the vibration system and lead to relatively large uncertainties of the dynamic response of system. The result is of significance for the design and condition monitoring of wind turbine drive trains. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to increase the reliability and availability of wind turbines, condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are considered crucial means to achieve these goals. In this context, direct drives wind turbines based on permanent-magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) with full-scale power converters are an emerging and promising technology. However, several statistical studies point out that power converters are a significant contributor to the overall failure rate of modern wind turbines. Accordingly, this paper presents a new algorithm for multiple open-circuit faults diagnosis in full-scale back-to-back converters, applied in PMSG drives used for wind turbine systems. The proposed method is based on a Luenberger observer and on an adaptive threshold, which can guarantee a reliable diagnosis independently of the drive operating conditions. Several simulation and experimental results using a PMSG drive with a full-scale converter are presented, showing the diagnostic algorithm effectiveness and robustness against false alarms for both generator-and grid-side converters.

AB Planetary gearboxes exhibit unique challenges in bearing fault detection. This paper presents a hybrid approach for fault diagnosis of planetary bearings using an internal vibration sensor and novel signal processing strategies. An accelerometer is mounted internally on the planet carrier to address the issues of variable transmission path. An effective bearing faults detection algorism is developed by employing several advanced signal processing techniques, including Cepstrum whitening, minimum entropy deconvolution (MED), spectral kurtosis (SK) and envelope analysis. The adverse effect of the electromagnetic interference in the signal due to the use of a slip ring is tackled by optimizing the SK technique for demodulation band selection. The proposed method is assessed by analyzing experimental data from a planetary gearbox test rig with seeded bearing faults. The result shows that the new method can effectively detect both inner race and outer race faults of the planetary bearing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Maintenance and repair of wind turbine structures have become more challenging and at the same time essential as they evolve into larger dimensions or located in places with limited access. Even small structural damages may invoke catastrophic detriment to the integrity of the system. So, cost-effective, predictive, and reliable structural health monitoring (SHM) system has been always desirable for wind turbines. A real-time nondestructive SHM technique based on multisensor data fusion is proposed in this paper. The objective is to critically analyze and evaluate the feasibility of the proposed technique to identify and localize damages in wind turbine blades. The structural properties of the turbine blade before and after damage are investigated through different sets of finiteelement method simulations. Based on the obtained results, it is shown that information from smart sensors, measuring strains, and vibrations data, distributed over the turbine blades can be used to assist in more accurate damage detection and overall understanding of the health condition of blades. Data fusion technique is proposed to combine these two diagnostic tools to improve the detection system that provides a more robust reading with reduced false alarms.

AB The extensive deployment of megawatt-scale wind turbines is bringing more challenges to the safety and stability of electric grid than ever before. This is not only because of the unstable wind over time but the increased risk of power quality pollution by defective wind turbines particularly when the turbines today are still experiencing various reliability issues. To prevent the power quality pollution by defective turbines, a new power quality monitoring technique dedicated for individual wind turbines is developed in this paper, so that the quality of the power generated by an individual turbine can be monitored by the wind turbine condition monitoring system. Through simulated and physical experiments on a specially designed test rig, some encouraging results have been achieved. It has been shown that the proposed technique is not only valid for monitoring the power quality of an individual wind turbine, but helpful in detecting the mechanical and electrical faults occurring in the wind turbines.

AB The paper proposes a methodology for reliable design and maintenance of wind turbine rotor blades using a condition monitoring approach and a damage tolerance index coupling the material and structure. By improving the understanding of material properties that control damage propagation it will be possible to combine damage tolerant structural design, monitoring systems, inspection techniques and modelling to manage the life cycle of the structures. This will allow an efficient operation of the wind turbine in terms of load alleviation, limited maintenance and repair leading to a more effective exploitation of offshore wind.

AB A wind turbine blade's structural dynamic response is simulated and analysed with the goal of characterizing the presence and severity of a shear web disbond. Computer models of a 5 MW offshore utility-scale wind turbine were created to develop effective algorithms for detecting such damage. Through data analysis and with the use of blade measurements, a shear web disbond was quantified according to its length. An aerodynamic sensitivity study was conducted to ensure robustness of the detection algorithms. In all analyses, the blade's flap-wise acceleration and root-pitching moment were the clearest indicators of the presence and severity of a shear web disbond. A combination of blade and non-blade measurements was formulated into a final algorithm for the detection and quantification of the disbond. The probability of detection was 100% for the optimized wind speed ranges in laminar, 30% horizontal shear and 60% horizontal shear conditions.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB The dynamic analysis of wind turbine drive train is presented in this paper. A typical wind turbine drive train consists of a rotor, gearbox and generator. The dynamic modelling of epicyclic gearbox that exists in wind turbine is challenging due to the fact that it has both rotating and orbiting gears. The dynamic equations of motion are obtained based on the rigid multibody modelling with discrete flexibility approach by Lagrange's formulation. The dynamic model accounts for the time varying gear tooth mesh stiffness, linear stiffness of bearings and torsional shaft stiffness. The aerodynamic torque that a wind turbine drive train subjected to, is modelled based on the simplified method for load calculation in wind turbine, Danish Standard DS472. The characteristic load value acting per unit length at the two-thirds length of the blade is used for calculating the total load of the torsional moment. The vibration signals that are obtained from wind turbine drive train are nonlinear and nonstationary in nature. This is due to the fact that the applied torque load on drive train is nonlinear and nonstationary in nature. The coupled dynamic model of 18 degrees of freedom is solved for responses in time and frequency domains for some nonstationary wind load realizations. The dynamic responses of the system, contact forces between gear tooth pairs in time and frequency domains are obtained numerically. The study envisages that this dynamic model of wind turbine drive train is very useful for subsequent studies on condition monitoring.

   dynamics; pitch control; structural health monitoring
AB Wind power is the world's fastest growing renewable energy source, but operations and maintenance costs are still a major obstacle toward reliability and widescale adoption of wind power, accounting for a large part of the cost of energy for offshore installations. Structural health monitoring systems have been proposed for implementing condition-based maintenance. The wind energy industry currently uses condition monitoring systems that are mostly adapted from roating machinery in other power generation industries. However, these systems have had limited effectiveness on wind turbines because of their atypical operating conditions, which are characterized by low and variable rotational speed, rapidly varying torque, extremely large rotors and stochastic loading from the wind. Although existing systems primarily take measurements from the nacelle, valuable information can be extracted from the structural dynamic response of the rotor blades to mitigate potentially damaging loading conditions. One such condition is rotor imbalance, which not only reduces the aerodynamic efficiency of the turbine and therefore its power output but can also lead to very large increases in loading on the drivetrain, blades and tower. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's fast software was used to model both mass and aerodynamic imbalance in a 5MW offshore wind turbine. It is shown that a combination of blade and nacelle measurements, most of which can be obtained from standard instrumentation already found on utility-scale wind turbines, can be formulated into an algorithm used to detect and locate imbalance. The method described herein allows for imbalance detection that is potentially more sensitive than existing on-line systems, while taking advantage of sensors that are already in place on many utility-scale wind turbines.

AB Increasing worldwide demand for energy has made wind energy a forerunner as a renewable energy resource. Due to this, and due to the intermittent nature of wind, Wind Turbines (WT) reliability should be considered. Improving the reliability of a WT translates into reduced operation and maintenance cost. This highlights the aim of this paper which is a technical review on WTs critical failures as well as an update on recent progress in fault diagnosis and condition monitoring methods used.

AB A wind farm often consists of a number of wind turbines (WTs) operating simultaneously, which not only challenges the operation of the wind farm but makes the condition monitoring (CM) more costly than ever before if each turbine is equipped with a standard commercially available WT CM system (e.g. SKF's WindCon system). With the continual increase of wind farm size, the operator is under increasing pressure to lower the CM cost so that the energy cost can be accordingly reduced in the end. The research presented in this paper is for meeting such a requirement by developing a new cost-effective CM technique based on detecting the transient period of a single WT generator stator current signal. Instead of collecting multiple numbers of CM signals from WT key components, the new technique relies on the use of only a single electric current signal collected from WT generator stator. Moreover, the new technique directly deals with the time waveform of the signal without using any artificial transforms (e.g. Fourier transform). Therefore, it is potentially able to provide more reliable CM result. Experiments have shown that the proposed technique is valid for detecting both the electrical and mechanical faults emulated on a specially designed WT drive train test rig.

AB Recently, alternative non-invasive methods based on electrical signature analysis have been proposed as an effective, easy and cheap way for electrical and mechanical faults detection in complex electromechanical systems such as wind turbines and traction systems. This paper aims to study the torsional vibration effects of a planetary gearbox which is a vital component of wind turbines on the electrical signatures of a wound rotor induction generator through both numerical simulations and experiments. A lumped model of planetary gearbox which needs minimum number of mechanical parameters is linked to the classical model of wound rotor induction generator in abc reference frame. The numerical simulation results show that some of mechanical characteristic frequencies of the planetary gearbox can be identified in the electromagnetic torque and stator current signatures of wound rotor induction generator. A reduced scale wind turbine simulator based on a 5.5 kW wound rotor induction generator is used for experimental verification of the proposed model at different working conditions.

AB Gearboxes are widely used in the drivetrain of rotating machines, such as helicopters and wind turbines. Tracking gearbox degradation is essential to remaining useful life prediction and maintenance decision. Though many degradation features such as root mean square, FM0, and FM4, have been developed, the effectiveness of these features depends on individual components or specific applications. To deploy autonomous fault diagnosis system, new degradation features are often required because a larger number of features facilitate data fusion and generate more accurate degradation paths. This paper proposes to use the parameters of stable distribution to track the degradation of gearbox systems. Two sets of gearbox run-to-failure data, one from laboratory test, and the other from field wind turbine, are used to examine whether the distribution parameters are capable of serving as degradation features. The results show that stable distribution parameters can potentially monitor the degradation trajectory based on their trending profile.

AB Vibration and temperature analysis are the two dominating condition monitoring techniques applied to fault detection of bearing failures in wind turbine generators. Relative movement between the bearing inner ring and generator axle is one of the most severe failure modes in terms of secondary damages and development. Detection of bearing creep can be achieved reliably based on continuous trending of the amplitude of vibration running speed harmonic and temperature absolute values. In order to decrease the number of condition indicators which need to be assessed, it is proposed to exploit a weighted average descriptor calculated based on the 3 rd up to 6 th harmonic orders. Two cases of different bearing creep severity are presented, showing the consistency of the combined vibration and temperature data utilization. In general, vibration monitoring reveals early signs of abnormality several months prior to any permanent temperature increase, depending on the fault development.

AB Wind turbines are renewable energy conversion devices that are being deployed in greater numbers. However, today's wind turbines are still expensive to operate, and maintain. The reduction of operational and maintenance costs has become a key driver for applying low-cost, condition monitoring and diagnosis systems in wind turbines. Accurate and timely detection, isolation and diagnosis of faults in a wind turbine allow satisfactory accommodation of the faults and, in turn, enhancement of the reliability, availability and productivity of wind turbines. The so called model-based Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) approaches utilize system model to carry out FDD in real-time. However, wind turbine systems are driven by wind as a stochastic aerodynamic input, and essentially exhibit highly nonlinear dynamics. Accurate modeling of such systems to be suitable for use in FDD applications is a rather difficult task. Therefore, this paper presents a data-driven modeling approach based on artificial intelligence (AI) methods which have excellent capability in describing complex and uncertain systems. In particular, two data-driven dynamic models of wind turbine are developed based on Fuzzy Modeling and Identification (FMI) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods. The developed models represent the normal operating performance of the wind turbine over a full range of operating conditions. Consequently, a model-based FDD scheme is developed and implemented based on each of the individual models. Finally, the FDD performance is evaluated and compared through a series of simulations on a well-known large offshore wind turbine benchmark in the presence of wind turbulences, measurement noises, and different realistic fault scenarios in the generator/converter torque actuator.

AB Wind turbine system is a safety-critical system, which has the demand to improve the operating reliability and reducing the cost caused by the shut-down time and component repairing. As a result, condition monitoring and fault diagnosis have received much attention for wind turbine energy systems. Noticing that environmental disturbances are unavoidable, therefore how to improve the robustness of a fault diagnosis scheme against disturbances/noises has been a key issue in fault diagnosis community. In this investigation, a robust fault estimation approach with the aid of eigenstructure assignment and genetic algorithm (GA) optimization is presented so that the estimation error dynamics has a good robustness against disturbances. A simulation study is carried out for a 5MW wind turbine dynamic model, which has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

AB The increasing amount of data produced in many scientific and engineering domains creates as many new challenges for an efficient data analysis, as possibilities for its application. In this paper, we present one of the use-cases of the project VAVID, namely the condition monitoring of sensor information from wind turbines, and how a data gateway can help to increase the usability and security of the proposed system. Starting by briefly introducing the project, the paper presents the problem of handling and processing large amount of sensor data using existing tools in the context of wind turbines. It goes on to describe the innovative approach used in VAVID to meet this challenge, covering the main goals, numerical methods used for analysis, the storage concept, and architectural design. It concludes by offering a rational for the use of a data gateway as the main entry point to the system and how this is being implemented in VAVID.

AB Along with the rapid growth of the wind energy sector, reducing the wind energy costs caused by unplanned downtimes and maintenances has aroused great concern of researchers. Condition monitoring system (CMS) is widely used for detecting anomalies of wind power plants (WPPs) so as to reduce the downtimes and optimize the maintenance plan. However, current solutions to condition monitoring of WPPs focus mostly on detecting a particular anomaly on a single component or a subsystem. Optimizing the maintenance plan of whole wind power plant requires a solution to system level condition monitoring of WPPs.
   This paper gives an approach for system level condition monitoring of WPPs using data driven method, that provides an overall picture of the system statuses. Firstly, cluster analysis is utilized to automatically learn the normal behavior model of WPPs from the observations. Two clustering algorithms are explored to choose a suitable one for modeling the WPPs. The presented anomaly detection algorithm uses the learned model as reference to detect the system anomalies. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated with real world data.

ID SYSTEM
AB Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data has been widely applied to identify abnormal conditions in wind turbine generators (WTG). One approach was to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) to SCADA data, comparing the predicted power output of a WTG and its actual output and using the prediction error as an indicator to detect faults. However, complicated training processes limit its application. This paper presents a normal behavior model (NBM), based on power output-generator speed (P-N) curve, to analyze SCADA data from modern pitch regulated WTGs for detecting anomalies. Through analysis of the operational characteristics of the pitch regulated WTG, it is found that inaccuracies in wind speed measurement, the inertia of the rotor, yaw and pitch misalignments, and air density fluctuation may affect the performance of the power curve monitoring algorithms. This paper shows that under normal conditions the P-N curve based NBM performs better when fitting the SCADA data to WTG output under normal conditions than the power curve. Results demonstrate that it can give alarm to forthcoming faults earlier than the existing condition monitoring system (CMS).

AB There is a large financial incentive to minimise operations and maintenance (O&M) costs for offshore wind power by optimising the maintenance plan. The integration of condition monitoring (CM) and structural health monitoring (SHM) may help realise this. There is limited work on the integration of both CM and SHM for offshore wind power or the use of imperfectly operating monitoring equipment. In order to investigate this, a dynamic Bayesian network and limit state equations are coupled with Monte Carlo simulations to deteriorate components in a wind farm.
   The CM system has a 'deterioration window' allowing for the possible detection of faults up to 6 months in advance. The SHM system model uses a reduction in the probability of failure factor to account for lower modelling uncertainties.
   A case study is produced that shows a reduction in operating costs and also a reduction in risk. The lifetime levelised costs are reduced by approximately 6%.

AB Online condition monitoring is an essential task for wind turbine generators' (WTG) reliability enhancement and availability. It leads to early fault detection which can aid in the avoidance of catastrophic failure and reduce the maintenance cost. A wind turbine (WT) test rig is important for the assessment of new methods before introducing them into a health monitoring and integrity diagnosis system. In this paper, a contribution to the development of low-cost WT test rig to assist the condition monitoring of WT is proposed. Depending on wind speed and load conditions, the WTG can operate continuously in non-stationary conditions to assist in condition monitoring. The response of generated current and terminal voltage has also been analysed under speed and load varying conditions. The effectiveness of the setup was benchmarked with already proven WT test rigs. The developed wind turbine emulator (WTE) can be analysed or reconfigured for condition monitoring of wind energy conversion systems (WECS) without the need for real WTs.

AB Wind turbines (WT) maintenance management is in continuous development to improve the reliability, availability, maintainability and safety (RAMS) of WTs, and to achieve time and cost reductions. The optimisation of the operation reliability involves the supervisory control and data acquisition to guarantee correct levels of RAMS. A fault detection and diagnosis methodology is proposed for large-scale industrialWTs. The method applies the wavelet and Fourier analysis to vibration signals. A number of turbines (up to 3) of the same type will be instrumented in the same wind farm. The data collected from the individual turbines will be fused and analysed together in order to determine the overall reliability of this particular wind farm and wind turbine type. It is expected that data fusion will allow a significant improvement in overall reliability since the value of the information gained from the various condition monitoring systems will be enhanced. Effort will also focus on the successful application of dependable embedded computer systems for the reliable implementation of wind turbine condition monitoring and control technologies.

   Threshold
AB Through the analysis of 50 doubly-fed wind turbine gearboxes, the fundamental vibration feature of wind turbine gearbox and the fluctuation range of vibration value during the normal operation were studied. The method of determining the vibration evaluation threshold by using statistical average and standard deviation was proposed. Statistical analysis was performed with 50 wind turbine gearbox vibration signals. The vibration alarm value and hazard value which were proper for model W2000 wind turbine gearbox were calculated and compared with the values given by the standard VDI 3834. The results show that the vibration threshold given by the standard VDI 3834 is conservative. The vibration threshold calculation method proposed in this paper is more suitable for condition monitoring of wind turbine.

AB Wind turbine power curve contains a large number of operational information, it helps to know the equipment operation state if we can analyze these data in a scientific way, it can also help to improve the wind turbine's reliability. This article focuses on two kinds of SCADA data modeling method: the first is parametric modeling based on logistic function, the second is high precision modeling based on least squares. These two methods were used to establish the wind turbine power curve models and the models can be used for condition monitoring when combine with control charts method. It is proved in the industrial case study that this method can detect abnormal SCADA data of wind turbine efficiently.

AB For economic and environmental reasons, wind turbines are becoming a potential renewable power source that could replace conventional fossil-fuelled plants. In remote areas where the power grid is unavailable, these wind plants may be equipped with self-excited induction generators. Order to maximize their productivity, the generators condition has to be continually monitored. For this purpose, many processing techniques have been interested to the analysis of fluently known signals such that vibration, ultrasound, acoustic emission, temperature, electrical amounts, etc. In this work, we present an innovative approach for monitoring the drive speed of such generator. The proposed technique is based on estimation of the instantaneous frequency related to the signal stemming from a stray flux sensor. Experimental investigations conducted on a laboratory test-rig have shown promising results in terms of speed monitoring by the employ of a low-cost sensor.

AB Vibration-based condition monitoring (CM) of geared utility-scale turbine drivetrains has been used by the wind industry to help improve operation and maintenance (O&M) practices, increase turbine availability, and reduce O&M cost. This study is a new endeavor that integrates the vibration-based CM technique with wind turbine gearbox modeling to investigate various gearbox design options. A team of researchers performed vibration-based CM measurements on a damaged wind turbine gearbox with a classic configuration, (i.e., one planetary stage and two parallel stages). We observed that the acceleration amplitudes around the first-order sidebands of the intermediate stage gear set meshing frequency were much lower than that measured at the high-speed gear set, and similar difference was also observed in a healthy gearbox. One factor for a reduction at the intermediate stage gear set is hypothesized to be the soft sun-spline configuration in the test gearbox. To evaluate this hypothesis, a multibody dynamic model of the healthy test gearbox was first developed and validated. Relative percent difference of the first-order sidebands of the highspeed and intermediate stage gear-meshing frequencies in the soft and the rigid sun spline configurations were compared. The results verified that the soft sun-spline configuration can reduce the sidebands of the intermediate stage gear set and also the locating bearing loads. The study demonstrates that combining vibration-based CM with appropriate modeling can provide insights for evaluating different wind turbine gearbox design options.

AB As wind energy is widely used nowadays, it is more and more important to predict wind turbine downtime and organize maintenance just in time. Two types of data systems have been widely adopted for monitoring wind turbine condition: supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and condition monitoring system (CMS). In this paper, a systematic framework is designed to combine CMS and SCADA data and assess drivetrain degradation. Advanced feature extraction techniques are applied to calculate health indicators. A pattern recognition algorithm is used to model baseline and actual condition, Self-organizing Map (SOM) and minimum quantization error (MQE) method is selected to do the degradation assessment. Eventually, the contribution of each component is calculated to achieve component-level fault localization. The approach is validated on a 2 MW wind turbine, where an incipient fault is detected before the wind turbine shuts down.

AB Operation and maintenance (OM) of offshore wind turbines contributes with a substantial part of the total levelized cost of energy (LCOE). The objective of this paper is to present an application of risk-and reliability-based methods for planning of OM. The theoretical basis is presented and illustrated by an example, namely for planning of inspections and maintenance of wind turbine blades. A life-cycle approach is used where the total expected cost in the remaining lifetime is minimized. This maintenance plan is continuously updated during the lifetime using information from previous inspections and from condition monitoring with time intervals between inspections and maintenance / repair options as the decision parameters.

AB Monitoring of trends and removal of undesired trends from operational/process parameters in wind turbines is important for their condition monitoring. This paper presents the homoscedastic nonlinear cointegration for the solution to this problem. The cointegration approach used leads to stable variances in cointegration residuals. The adapted Breusch-Pagan test procedure is developed to test for the presence of heteroscedasticity in cointegration residuals obtained from the nonlinear cointegration analysis. Examples using three different time series data sets-that is, one with a nonlinear quadratic deterministic trend, another with a nonlinear exponential deterministic trend, and experimental data from a wind turbine drivetrain-are used to illustrate the method and demonstrate possible practical applications. The results show that the proposed approach can be used for effective removal of nonlinear trends form various types of data, allowing for possible condition monitoring applications.

AB This paper outlines the initial framework of a dynamic beam Spectral Element Method (SEM) wind turbine model used for estimation of dynamic loads experienced by the wind turbine rotor and tower during operation. Laboratory experiments to characterize various dynamic forms of dynamic loading on wind turbines has been completed. The development of a Condition Monitoring (CM) system for a wind turbine requires an efficient numerical model. An efficient numerical model can compare output-only data by solving an inverse problem to create an estimate of the dynamic and static loads on the wind turbine rotor and tower. Characterizing adverse operating conditions are of interest because they can produce detrimental large amplitude vibrations. The numerical model being developed uses the Legendre Gauss-Lobatto (GLL) SEM spatial integration, and second order Adamas-Moulton scheme for temporal integration, simulating a Timoshenko beam. The efficiency of the GLL SEM makes it an attractive candidate for CM use if the model is to be used in an iterative error minimization scheme. The intended implementation of this numerical model is to modify the stiffnesses and forces of the model to minimize error between the model and experimental data. For CM applications this can be used to identify adverse conditions. Reducing the computational cost of the numerical model in the iterative scheme could provide drastic decreases in analysis time.

AB The operation and maintenance (O&M) costs associated with wind turbines are comparatively high due to the size and complexity of large wind turbine systems. Remote and harsh field locations such as offshore wind farms can further rise those costs. There is a clear need to instrument wind turbines to monitor their behavior to identify damage and deterioration in an effort to lower O&M costs. Towards this end, this study focuses on the deployment of a low-cost wireless monitoring system on a 3kW wind turbine tower to monitor the behavior of the tower under various operational states. Acceleration data and its spectral representation is used to ascertain the normal (undamaged) behavior of the wind turbine under varying environmental and operational conditions.

AB As wind turbines get larger, operation and maintenance costs can be expected to rise unless reliability is improved. One important strategy for achieving this is through condition monitoring. Condition monitoring is a preventive type of maintenance based on the actual health of the wind turbine under observation. Its use allows an operational strategy to be employed based on information measured and provided by a condition monitoring system. This paper outlines the procedure for least square static calibration of inexpensive Microelectromechanical Systems accelerometers identified and instrumented for detecting and measuring changes in natural frequency (key information useful for condition monitoring) of a 4.5 m long wind turbine blade. The calibration procedure converts the local accelerometer coordinates to the global coordinate system of the blade and eliminates the accelerometer offsets from results. The objective is to enable easier comparison of results obtained from multiple accelerometers positioned arbitrarily along the blade, independent of the accelerometer orientation on the usually curved wind turbine blade surface.

AB Wind turbine condition monitoring and fault warning has important practical value to reduce maintenance costs, improve operational efficiency and reliability. In this paper, the characteristic parameters of SCADA system monitoring, based on the principle of similarity modeling techniques, through reasonable storage matrix construction process, the establishment of the gear box "health model" to cover the gearbox to work space. When the gearbox operation occurs, characterized in health parameters deviate from the model, when the offset distance exceeds the threshold value, the system gives the warning. Finally, the health model was validated, experiments show that the method used in this paper can be found early signs of abnormal gearbox and give warning. The results show that the health model by the similar principle established can identify abnormal state timely and accurately, and warning given before a failure occurs, which makes it easier to advance plans to organize maintenance equipment and personnel, to provide a reference for on-site maintenance.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Doubly-fed induction generator is widely used in wind turbine conversion systems. Several research works are being made to efficiently approve existing condition monitoring and fault detection techniques for these systems. The condition monitoring of these systems becomes more and more important, the main obstacle in this task is the lack of an accurate analytical model to describe a faulty DFIG in the majority of the research tasks. In this paper, we present the monitoring strategy of short-circuit fault between turns of the stator windings and open stator phases in doubly-fed induction generator by fuzzy logic technique. The stator condition monitoring is diagnosed based on the root mean square values of current magnitude in addition to the knowledge expressed in rules and membership function. The proposed strategy is verified using simulations performed via the model of Doubly-fed induction generator built in MatLab (R) SIMULINK. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents an intelligent diagnosis technique for wind turbine imbalance fault identification based on generator current signals. For this aim, Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), which is powerful algorithm for classification problems that needs small training time in solving nonlinear problems and applicable to high dimension applications, is employed. The complete dynamics of a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based wind-turbine (WTG) model are imitated in an amalgamated domain of Simulink, FAST and TurbSim under six distinct conditions, i.e., aerodynamic asymmetry, rotor furl imbalance, tail furl imbalance, blade imbalance, nacelle-yaw imbalance and normal operating scenarios. The simulation results in time domain of the PMSG stator current are decomposed into the Intrinsic Mode Frequency (IMF) using EMD method, which are utilized as input variable in PNN. The analyzed results proclaim the effectiveness of the proposed approach to identify the healthy condition from imbalance faults in WTG. The presented work renders initial results that are helpful for online condition monitoring and health assessment of WTG. 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Wind energy is seen as one of t he most promising solutions to man's ever increasing demands of a clean source of energy. In particular to reduce the cost of energy (COE) generated, there are effo rts to increase the life-time of the wind turbines, to reduce maintenance costs and to ensure high availability.
   Maintenance costs may be lowered and the high availability and low repair co sts ensured through the use of condition monitoring (CM) and structural health monitoring (SHM). SHM allows early detection of damage and allows maintenance planning. Furthermore, it can allow us to avoid unnecessary downtime, hence increasing the availability of the system.
   The present work is based on the use of neutral axis (NA) for SHM of the structure. The NA is tracked by data fusion of measured yaw angle and strain through the use of Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The EKF allows accurate tracking even in the presence of changing ambient conditions. NA is defined as the line or plane in the section of the beam which does not experience any tensile or compressive forces when loaded. The NA is the property of the cross section of the tower and is ind ependent of the applied loads and ambient conditions. Any change in the NA position may be used for detecting and locating the damage. The wind turbine tower has been modelled with FE so ftware ABAQUS and validated on data from load measurements carried out on the 34m high tower of the Nordtank, NTK 500/41 wind turbine.

The thresholds are imposed on the measured values such as vibration-based indicators, temperature, pressure, etc. For complex machinery such as wind turbine (WT) the total number of thresholds might be counted in hundreds multiplied by the number of operational states. All the parameters vary not only due to possible machinery malfunctions, but also due to changes in operating conditions and these changes are typically much stronger than the former ones. Very often, such a behavior may lead to hundreds of false alarms. Therefore, authors propose a novel approach based on parameterized description of the threshold violation. For this purpose the novelty and severity factors are introduced. The first parameter refers to the time of violation occurrence while the second one describes the impact of the indicator-increase to the entire machine. Such approach increases reliability of the CMS by providing the operator with the most useful information of the system events. The idea of the procedure is presented on a simulated data similar to those from a wind turbine.

AB A hybrid fiber-optic sensor system which combines fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors and a Michelson interferometer is suggested for condition monitoring uses of large scale wind turbine blades. The system uses single broadband light source to address both sensors, which simplifies the optical setup and enhances the cost-effectiveness of condition monitoring system. An athermal-packaged FBG is used to supply quasi-coherent light for the Michelson interferometer demodulation. For the feasibility test, different profiles of test strain, temperature and vibration have been applied to test structures, and successfully reconstructed with the proposed sensor system.

AB A fiber-optic epoxy cure monitoring technique for efficient wind turbine blade manufacturing and monitoring is presented. To optimize manufacturing cycle, fiber-optic sensors are embedded in composite materials of wind turbine blades. The reflection spectra of the sensors indicate the onset of gelification and the completion of epoxy curing. After manufacturing process, the same sensors are utilized for in-field condition monitoring. Because of residual stresses and strain gradients from the curing process, the embedded sensors may experience distortions in reflection spectra, resulting in measurement errors. We applied a Gaussian curve-fitting algorithm to the distorted spectra, which substantially improved the measurement accuracy.

AB Over the last 16 years, pioneering research work has resulted in significant progress in the area of acoustic emission condition monitoring of wind turbine blades. From laboratory static tests on small blades to laboratory full-scale fatigue tests, then to static field tests on actual wind turbines, we are now in the position to instrument and monitor in real time the structural integrity of rotating blades on operating machines with multichannel acoustic emission systems, via the Internet.
   This chapter provides an overview of the research conducted, the various types of tests carried out, and the milestones in developing the application, and summarizes the recent developments on in-service monitoring of wind turbine blades during operation. Emphasis is given to the difficulties faced, the means these were overcome, the challenges that still need to be dealt with, and propositions for future work and research. Apart from summary results from the initial and subsequent laboratory experiments, characteristic results from recent long-term health monitoring of the blades of an operating machine with acoustic emission are presented. The importance of fusion of acoustic emission data with operational data from the wind turbine (wind speed, torque, RPM, etc.), for the proper assessment of the blade's condition, is also demonstrated.

AB Improvement of condition monitoring (CM) systems for wind turbines (WTs) and reduction of the cost of wind energy are possible if knowledge about the condition of different WT components is available. CM based on the WT drive train shaft torque signal can give a better understanding of the gearbox failure mechanisms as well as provide a method for detecting mass imbalance and aerodynamic asymmetry. The major obstacle preventing the industrial application of CM based on the shaft torque signal is the costly measurement equipment which is impractical for long-term use on operating WTs. This paper suggests a novel approach for low-cost, indirect monitoring of the shaft torque from standard WT measurements. The shaft torque is estimated recursively from measurements of generator torque, high speed shaft and low speed shaft angular speeds using the well-known Kalman filter theory. The performance of the augmented Kalman filter with fading memory (AKFF) is compared with the augmented Kalman filter (AKF) using simulated data of the WT for different load conditions, measurement noise levels and WT fault scenarios. A multiple-model algorithm, based on a set of different Kalman filters, is designed for practical implementation of the shaft torque estimator. Its performance is validated for a scenario where there are frequent changes of operating points. The proposed cost-effective shaft torque estimator overcomes all major problems, which prevent the industrial application of CM systems based on shaft torque measurements. Future work will be focused on validating the method using experimental data and developing suitable signal processing algorithms for fault detection. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DE Transmissibility analysis; Wind turbine blade; Condition monitoring;
   Frequency methods
AB Wind turbine blade has a high failure rate as it has to constantly work under varying loads and occasionally suffer extreme weather like storm and sleet. Online condition monitoring plays an important role in finding early or minor damage to avoid catastrophic failure. Due to the large size of blade, condition monitoring systems often use multi-sensors to obtain the blade conditions in different locations. To deal with the multi-sensor data, most conventional frequency methods deal with the multiple sensor data separately without consideration of their correlations. Further, they have to use multiple indicators to represent conditions of different locations. Third, most of frequency methods are dependent on the dynamic loadings and therefore different frequency features and thresholds have to be determined under different loading conditions. To address these problems, this paper employs transmissibility analysis for multi-sensor based wind turbine blade condition monitoring. Transmissibility analysis considers the relations between different senors in the frequency domain, and only produces one single transmissibility damage indicator to represent the condition of the whole wind turbine blade. This is independent of loading conditions and computationally efficient as the main computations only involve Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The effectiveness of the transmissibility analysis is demonstrated using both simulation example and experimental data analysis.

DE acoustic emission; condition monitoring; WTS; NDT
AB Acoustic emission (AE) method of nondestructive check is based on exertion wave radiation and their registration during fast local material structure reorganization. It is used as a means of analysis of materials, constructions, productions control and diagnosis during operating time. In the article, it is applied to structural health monitoring of Wind Turbine Shaft (WTS). Acoustic emission testing has been used for years to test metallic structures. More recently it has become the primary method of testing WTS. However in large structures, the high acoustic attenuation in WTS precludes amplitude analysis unless the origin of the individual signals can be identified and corrections for the distances traveled applied to the signal amplitudes. The usual method of testing WTS structures has been applied an array of sensors spaced so that a moderate amplitude AE signal will just barely trigger each sensor occurring midway between them.

AB Offshore wind turbine requires more systematized operation and maintenance strategies to ensure systems are harmless, profitable and cost-effective. Condition monitoring and fault diagnostic systems ominously plays an important role in offshore wind turbine in order to cut down maintenance and operational costs. Condition monitoring techniques which describing complex faults and failure mode types and their generated traceable signs to provide cost-effective condition monitoring and predictive maintenance and their diagnostic schemes. Continuously monitor the condition of critical parts are the most efficient way to improve reliability of wind turbine. Implementation of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) strategy provides right time maintenance decisions and Predictive Health Monitoring (PHM) data to overcome breakdown and machine downtime. Fault detection and CBM implementation is challenging for off shore wind farm due to the complexity of remote sensing, components health and predictive assessment, data collection, data analysis, data handling, state recognition, and advisory decision. The rapid expansion of wind farms, advanced technological development and harsh installation sites needs a successful CM approach. This paper aims to review brief status of recent development of CM techniques and focusing with major faults takes place in gear box and bearing, rotor and blade, pitch, yaw and tower system and generator and control system.

AB Wind energy is an emerging, clean and renewable source of energy. It is estimated that by year 2035, wind energy will be generating more than 25% of the world's electricity according to International Energy Agency (IEA). With the increase in demand for wind energy, its maintenance issues are becoming more prominent. The scheduled maintenance is more economical than unscheduled repair resulting from failure. So a continuous condition monitoring of various critical components like bearings, gearbox, and shafts of wind turbine is essential in order to enable predictive maintenance. 10% of the total failure is contributed by the bearings, shaft and gear box failures, but the downtime is more than 50% of the total downtime. This paper discusses the development of a bench-top test rig which is designed to mimic the operating condition of an actual wind turbine and use it for monitoring its condition so as to diagnose the incipient faults in its critical components using latest machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Wind energy, being the fastest growing renewable energy source in the present world, requires a large number of wind turbines to transform wind energy into electricity. One factor driving the cost of this energy is the reliable operation of these turbines. Therefore, it is a growing requirement within the wind farm community, to monitor the operation of the wind turbines on a continuous basis so that a possible fault can be detected ahead of time. As the wind turbine operates in an environment of constantly changing wind speed, it is a challenging task to design a fault detection technique which can accommodate the stochastic operational behavior of the turbines. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault detection criterion which is robust against operational uncertainty, as well as having the ability to quantify severity level specifically of the drivetrain abnormality within an operating wind turbine. A benchmark model of wind turbine has been utilized to simulate drivetrain fault condition and effectiveness of the proposed technique has been tested accordingly. From the simulation result it can be concluded that the proposed criterion exhibits consistent performance for drivetrain faults for varying wind speed and has linear relationship with the fault severity level.

AB As the wind power system moves toward more efficient operation, one of the main challenges for managers is to determine a cost effective maintenance strategy. Most maintenance optimization studies for wind power generation systems deal with wind turbine components separately. However, there are economic dependencies among wind turbines and their components. In addition, most current researches assume that the components in a wind turbine only have two states, while condition monitoring techniques can often provide more detailed health information of components. This study aims to construct an optimal condition based maintenance model for a multi-state wind farm under the condition that individual components or subsystems can be monitored in periodic inspection. The results are demonstrated using a numerical example.

AB Nowadays, there is a growing interest in the development of offshore wind farms due to the increasing size and capacity of wind turbines, improvement of wind resources, social acceptance, noise reduction, depletion of onshore locations with great wind resources, etc. However, the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs are too high to make offshore wind turbines economically viable. The use of condition monitoring systems (CMS) appears as a solution to minimize O&M costs and increase the reliability of offshore wind farms. The quantification of the economic benefits of CMS is a non-trivial problem. In this work is presented a novel maintenance management research based of an economic study of the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of CMS for offshore wind turbines. The model includes the costs of investment and O&M of the CMS and costs for reduction of O&M and energy losses of the wind turbine generates by the implementation of CMS. These costs are related with a reliability analysis of a real case study. The application of the economic model on a real case study assuming different scenarios enables the analysis of the economic benefits to use CMS in offshore wind turbines.

ID MODEL
AB The structure of the wind turbines nowadays is a critical element due to their importance from the reliability, availability, safety, and cost points of view. This is more relevant when the offshore wind turbine is considered. This paper introduces a novel design of a Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) model based on ultrasound technique. The FDD model will be able to detect fault/failures via the pulseecho technique. The pulse-echo is got via piezoelectric transducers that are also employed as sensors. The signal processing is based on two steps. Firstly, a wavelet transform is applied to the measured signals with filtering purposes, in order to enhance the signal to noise ratio. Secondly, a time series modeling approach, as an autoregressive with exogenous input model, is employed for pattern recognition by minimizing the Akaike information criterion. An experimental platform is proposed to test the procedure, where pulse-echo experiments were employed before and after a fault occurred. The results from this paper lead to the identification of an early indication of structural problems induced by internal (material, shape, age, etc.) and external (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.) factors. The model can anticipate catastrophic faults, reducing the preventive/corrective tasks and costs, etc, and increasing the availability of the wind turbine, and therefore the energy production.

TI Copula-based model for wind turbine power curve outlier rejection
SO WIND ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
DE wind turbine; power curve; outlier rejection; SCADA; copula model
AB Power curve measurements provide a conventional and effective means of assessing the performance of a wind turbine, both commercially and technically. Increasingly high wind penetration in power systems and offshore accessibility issues make it even more important to monitor the condition and performance of wind turbines based on timely and accurate wind speed and power measurements. Power curve data from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system records, however, often contain significant measurement deviations, which are commonly produced as a consequence of wind turbine operational transitions rather than stemming from physical degradation of the plant. Using such raw data for wind turbine condition monitoring purposes is thus likely to lead to high false alarm rates, which would make the actual fault detection unreliable and would potentially add unnecessarily to the costs of maintenance. To this end, this paper proposes a probabilistic method for excluding outliers, developed around a copula-based joint probability model. This approach has the capability of capturing the complex non-linear multivariate relationship between parameters, based on their univariate marginal distributions; through the use of a copula, data points that deviate significantly from the consolidated power curve can then be removed depending on this derived joint probability distribution. After filtering the data in this manner, it is shown how the resulting power curves are better defined and less subject to uncertainty, whilst broadly retaining the dominant statistical characteristics. These improved power curves make subsequent condition monitoring more effective in the reliable detection of faults. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID DIAGNOSIS; MOTORS; FAULTS
AB This study presents a new technique for detecting rotor electrical faults in wind turbine doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs), controlled by a stator field-oriented vector control scheme. This is a novel method aimed at detecting and identifying rotor electrical asymmetry faults from within the rotor-side inverter control loop, using the error signal, to provide a future method of generator condition monitoring with enhanced detection sensitivity. Simulation and experimental measurements of the proposed signals were carried out under steady-state operation for both healthy and faulty generator conditions. Stator current and power were also investigated for rotor electrical asymmetry detection and comparison made with rotor-side inverter control signals. An investigation was then performed to define the sensitivity of the proposed monitoring signals to fault severity changes and a comparison made with previous current, power and vibration signal methods. The results confirm that a simple spectrum analysis of the proposed control loop signals gives effective and sensitive DFIG rotor electrical asymmetry detection.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB This paper proposes a data driven model-based condition monitoring scheme that is applied to wind turbines. The scheme is based upon a non-linear data-based modelling approach in which the model parameters vary as functions of the system variables. The model structure and parameters are identified directly from the input and output data of the process. The proposed method is demonstrated with data obtained from a simulation of a grid-connected wind turbine where it is used to detect grid and power electronic faults. The method is evaluated further with SCADA data obtained from an operational wind farm where it is employed to identify gearbox and generator faults. In contrast to artificial intelligence methods, such as artificial neural network-based models, the method employed in this paper provides a parametrically efficient representation of non-linear processes. Consequently, it is relatively straightforward to implement the proposed model-based method on-line using a field-programmable gate array. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Blades are among the key components of wind turbines. Blade damage is one of the most common types of structural defects and can cause catastrophic structural failure. Therefore, it is highly desirable to detect and diagnose blade damage as early as possible. In this paper, we propose a method for blade damage detection and diagnosis. This method incorporates finite element method (FEM) for dynamics analysis (modal analysis and response analysis) and the mode shape difference curvature (MSDC) information for damage detection/diagnosis. Finite element models of wind turbine blades have been built and modified via frequency comparison with experimental data and the formula for the model updating technique. Our numerical simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed technique can detect the spatial locations of damages for wind turbine blades. Changes in natural frequencies and modes for smaller size blades with damage are found to occur at lower frequencies and lower modes than in the larger sized blade case. The relationship between modal parameters and damage information (location, size) is very complicated especially for larger size blades. Moreover, structure and dynamic characters for larger size blades are different from those for smaller sized blades. Therefore, dynamic response analysis for a larger sized wind turbine blade with a multi-layer composite material based on aerodynamic loads' (including lift forces and drag forces) calculation has been carried out and improved the efficiency and precision to damage detection by combining (MSDC) information. This method provides a low cost and efficient non-destructive tool for wind turbine blade condition monitoring. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Within this paper a new approach for early damage detection in rotor blades of wind energy converters is presented, which is shown to have a more sensitive reaction to damage than eigenfrequency-based methods. The new approach is based on the extension of Gasch's proportionality method, according to which maximum oscillation velocity and maximum stress are proportional by a factor, which describes the dynamic behavior of the structure. A change in the proportionality factor can be used as damage indicator. In addition, a novel deflection sensor was developed, which was specifically designed for use in wind turbine rotor blades. This deflection sensor was used during the experimental tests conducted for the measurement of the blade deflection. The method was applied on numerical models for different damage cases and damage extents. Additionally, the method and the sensing concept were applied on a real 50.8 m blade during a fatigue test in the edgewise direction. During the test, a damage of 1.5 m length was induced on the upper trailing edge bondline. Both the initial damage and the increase of its length were successfully detected by the decrease of the proportionality factor. This decrease coincided significantly with the decrease of the factor calculated from the numerical analyses.

TI Development of a baseline as a novel strategy for a condition monitoring
   system for the assessment of wind turbine generators
SO INSIGHT
LA English
DT Article
AB Existing wind turbine condition monitoring methodologies can be time-consuming and costly processes that fail to achieve the reliability and operational efficiency required by the industry[1]. Present studies on monitoring data for wind turbines is restricted to a few case histories and for certain sensors is yet scarcer[2]. In order to overcome this issue, the development of a reliable baseline is desirable. In this paper, motor current signature analysis (MCSA) is proposed in order to generate a baseline to define the normal operating conditions of the induction generator in a wind turbine. Electrical current data is collected for an initial period of time, serving as a training process. Different signal processing methods are used to extract the wind turbine generator's features. The features extracted during this initial period are used to create a baseline that defines the behaviour of the generator under normal operation. A range of maximum and minimum values for these features is calculated using statistical methods. Using this approach, the generator monitoring process can be performed by comparing each new set of data acquired to the original baseline created during the initial stage.

   defect detection; failure; pitting
AB The wind energy industry continuously demands significant improvements in wind turbine maintenance strategies through the use of condition monitoring systems (CMS). Regardless of their design, wind turbines have rotating parts that need to be monitored during operation in order to avoid unpredicted failures. In this paper, an experiment conducted at the University of Newcastle is described and initial data analysis is presented. The experiment was performed in a gear test-rig of the Design Unit department, where gearbox contact fatigue tests are frequently performed. The testing procedure involves running of the gears to destruction; starting with 'fresh' gears and operating for a period of time until they fail. In this experiment, the gear being monitored is periodically checked to give an indication of the tooth's cross-section loss. A combination of vibration analysis and acoustic emission (AE) analysis is utilised in this experiment as it is believed that, for reliable diagnosis of rotating machinery, multi-sensing technology should be used. Accelerometers and acoustic emission sensors were deployed throughout the tests, which were conducted in five stages over seven weeks. For the vibration data processing and calculation of the data, the root mean square (RMS) and crest factor values are calculated and frequency spectrum analysis is performed. For the acoustic emission data processing, RMS and energy parameters are calculated. These parameters are shown giving information about the potential gear deterioration over time. Finally, the results of the experiment are presented and show minimal changes in the vibration and acoustic emission parameters in the first two stages of the tests, indicating a reliable baseline reading. However, in the later stages of the tests, data showed a very clear indication of possible gear deterioration, with an increase in the values of RMS for both acoustic emission and vibration data and a modal shift in the vibration spectrum. Visual inspection performed afterwards confirmed the onset of severe macro-pitting failures in the gears.

TI Method for computing efficient electrical indicators for offshore wind
   turbine monitoring
SO INSIGHT
LA English
DT Article
AB The availability of offshore wind turbines is an important issue if such wind farms are to be considered a reliable source of renewable energy for the future. Environmental conditions and the low accessibility of such wind farms have contributed to a decrease in the availability of these wind turbines, compared to onshore ones. In order to improve reliability, condition monitoring systems and the implementation of scheduled maintenance strategies are a must for offshore power plants.
   This paper proposes a method for computing efficient electrical indicators using the available three-phase electrical quantities. These indicators are then to be used to obtain fault indicators for fault detection and diagnosis. The electrical indicators are obtained by using instantaneous symmetrical component decomposition, a well-proven method in the design and diagnosis of power networks. The new quantities are able to fully describe the whole electrical system and provide an effective means to quantify the balance and unbalance in the system. The method uses the electrical three-phase quantities measured at the output of the generator in a wind turbine to obtain the indicators. The performance of this method is illustrated using both synthetic and experimental data.

AB In this paper, a prognostic method is presented for fault detection in gears and bearings in wind turbine drivetrains. This method is based on angular velocity measurements from the gearbox input shaft and the output to the generator, using two additional angular velocity sensors on the intermediate shafts inside the gearbox. An angular velocity error function is defined and compared in the faulty and fault-free conditions in frequency domain. Faults can be detected from the change in the energy level of the frequency spectrum of an error function. The method is demonstrated by detecting bearing faults in three locations: the high-speed shaft stage, the planetary stage and the intermediate-speed shaft stage. Simulations of the faulty and fault-free cases are performed on a gearbox model implemented in multibody dynamic simulation software. The global loads on the gearbox are obtained from a dynamometer test bench and applied to the numerical gearbox model. The method is exemplified using a 750 kW wind turbine gearbox. The case study results show that defects in the high- and intermediate-speed bearings can be detected using this method. It is shown that this procedure is relatively simple, yet accurate enough for early fault detection in wind turbine gearboxes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Condition monitoring helps reduce the operations and maintenance costs by providing information about the physical condition of wind power systems. This study proposes to use a statistical method for effective condition monitoring. The turbine operation is significantly affected by external weather conditions. We model the wind turbine response as a function of weather variables, using a nonparametric regression method named least squares support vector regression. In practice, online condition monitoring of wind power systems often relies on datasets contaminated with outliers. This study proposes to use a weighted version of least squares support vector regression that provides a formal procedure for removing the outlier effects. We determine the decision boundaries to distinguish faulty conditions from normal conditions by examining the variations in the operational responses that are significantly affected by external weather. The results show that the proposed method effectively detects anomalies.

AB Condition monitoring of bearings used in Wind Turbines (WT) is an important issue. In general, bearings diagnostics is a well recognized field of research; however, it is not the case for machines operating under non-stationary load. In the case of varying load/speed, vibration signal generated by rolling element bearings is affected by operation factors, and makes the diagnosis relatively difficult. These difficulties come from the variation of vibration-based diagnostic features caused mostly by load/speed variation (operation factors), low energy of sought-after features, and low signal-to-noise levels. Analysis of the signal from the main bearing is even more difficult due to a very low rotational speed of the main shaft. In the paper, a novel diagnostic approach is proposed for bearings used in wind turbines. As an input data we use parameters obtained from commercial diagnostic system (peak-to-peak and root mean square (RMS) of vibration acceleration, and generator power that is related to the operating conditions). The received data cover the period of several months.
   The method presented in the paper was triggered by two case studies, which will be presented here: first when the bearing has been replaced due to its failure and the new one has been installed, second when bearing in good condition has significantly changed its condition. Due to serious variability of the mentioned data, a decision making process on the condition of bearings is difficult. Application of classical statistical pattern recognition techniques for "bad condition" and "good condition" data is not sufficient because the probability distribution/density functions (pdf) of features overlap each other (for example probability distribution/density function of peak-to-peak feature for bad and good conditions). It was found that these data are strongly dependent on operating condition (generator power) variation, and there is a need to remove such dependency by suitable data presentation. To achieve it, load susceptibility characteristics (LSCh) presenting as feature - operating condition space has been used. Presented approach is based on an idea proposed earlier for planetary gearboxes, i.e. to analyse data for bad/good conditions in two dimensional space, feature - load/rotation speed. Here it has been proven experimentally for the first time that there are two types of susceptibility characteristics related to the type of a fault.
   The novelty of the paper also comes from an extension of previous study that is statistical processing of data (linear regression analysis) in moving window in the long time of a turbine operation is used for feature extraction. It is proposed here to use novel features for long term monitoring. It will be shown that parameters of regression analysis can be used as unvarying, and fault sensitive features for decision making.

AB The benefit of wind turbine (WT) can be significantly improved through a well-organized condition-based maintenance strategy. However, such a target has not been fully achieved today. One of the major reasons is lack of an efficient WT condition monitoring system (CMS). The existing WT CMSs often involve high initial capital cost, with complex structure, suffer from inefficient management and show unsatisfactory hardware reliability. So, the operators still have desire for an economical, effective, and reliable CMS for their machines. The work reported in this paper is intended to meet such a demand. Because direct drive permanent magnet (PM) WTs are showing increased market share, but the existing WT CMSs are not designed to deal specifically with this new design, this paper reports on a CM technique dedicated to monitoring the drive train of direct drive WTs. Instead of taking the vibration analysis approach that is being popularly adopted by commercial WT CMSs, a novel CM strategy is researched in this paper by introducing generator electrical signals into WT CM and interpreting them by using a dedicated criterion named instantaneous variance (IV) and Teager-Huang transform (THT), i.e. the generator electrical signals will be evaluated first by using the IV, of which the fault detection capability can be further enhanced with the aid of empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Once an abnormality is detected, then detailed THT analysis of the signal will be conducted for further investigation. The technique has been verified experimentally on a specifically designed WT drive train test rig, on which a PM generator rotates at slow variable speed and is subjected to varying load like a real WT does. Considering the electric subassemblies and rotor blades of direct drive WTs are most vulnerable to damage in practice, rotor unbalance and generator winding faults were emulated on the test rig. Experimental results show that the proposed CM technique is effective in detecting both types of faults occurring in the drive train of direct drive PM WTs. In summary, the proposed CM technique can be identified by (i) the CM is accomplished through analyzing the generator electrical signals without resorting to any other information (e. g. vibro-acoustic). Hence, the data acquisition work will be eased off; (ii) no more transducer other than current and voltage sensors are required. Thus, the cost of the CMS will be significantly reduced; (iii) attributed to the distinguished superiorities of THT to traditional spectral analyses in processing nonlinear signals, the proposed technique is more reliable in interpreting WT CM signals; and (iv) the CM criterion IV has a simple computational algorithm. It is therefore suited to both online and offline WT CM applications.

AB Wind turbine operational costs can be reduced by monitoring the condition of major components in the drivetrain. SCADA-based condition monitoring is attractive because the data are already collected, resulting in rapid deployment and modest set-up cost. Three SCADA-based monitoring methods were reviewed: signal trending; self-organising maps and physical model. The physical model was identified as being the most reliable at predicting impending component failures. A validation study on this method using five operational wind farms showed that it is possible to achieve a high detection rate and good detection accuracy. An advance detection period of between 1 month and 2 years was achieved by the method. The study has also highlighted limitations and areas for further development.

AB The ability to detect and diagnose incipient gear and bearing degradation can offer substantial improvements in reliability and availability of the wind turbine asset. Considering the motivation for improved reliability of the wind turbine drive train, numerous research efforts have been conducted using a vast array of vibration-based algorithms. Despite these efforts, the techniques are often evaluated on smaller-scale test-beds, and existing studies do not provide a detailed comparison between the various vibration-based condition monitoring algorithms. This study evaluates a multitude of methods, including frequency domain and cepstrum analysis, time synchronous averaging narrowband and residual methods, bearing envelope analysis and spectral kurtosis-based methods. A full-scale baseline wind turbine drive train and a drive train with several gear and bearing failures are tested at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) dynamometer test cell during the NREL Gear Reliability Collaborative Round Robin study. A tabular set of results is presented to highlight the ability of each algorithm to accurately detect the bearing and gear wheel component health. The results highlight that the cepstrum and the narrowband phase modulation signal were effective methods for diagnosing gear tooth problems, whereas bearing envelope analysis could confidently detect most of the bearing-related failures.

AB This paper presents effective and accurate approaches in vibration-based wind turbine drivetrain component condition monitoring. Detailed spectral analysis and acceleration enveloping techniques were used to effectively extract the gear and bearing damage features. Synchronous analysis was used to accurately detect specific damage features during constantly varying operational conditions. A typical wind turbine gearbox amplifies shaft speed two orders of magnitude from the rotor to the generator. To account for all necessary vibration signatures, synchronous sampling must be carried out for multiple revolutions and at a relatively high rate. The synchronous sampling used in this paper was carried out in the digital domain after both the keyphasor and the vibration signals were digitized at high sampling rate and high sampling resolution analog-to-digital conversion. Sometimes, the shaft speed is provided in a speed time history format, as in the case of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Round Robin project. To carry out synchronous sampling using the speed time history, a unique synthesized synchronous sampling technique was adopted. The approach presented in this paper was realized using MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) codes and then validated with a wind turbine field case. It was also applied to the NREL wind turbine drivetrain condition monitoring Round Robin project. The identified damage results using the techniques discussed were compared with post-test inspection results with good correlation. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Impact Technologies' participation in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Wind Turbine Gearbox Condition Monitoring Round Robin focused on applying multiple vibration diagnostic algorithms to the provided data set. These approaches have been developed and matured by the team in Department of Defense applications for more than 10 years. Generally, the methods employed by the team worked well, once the challenges and peculiarities of the data set were realized. The results of these automated algorithms were also corroborated with visual spectral analysis. Both the blind results, obtained without knowing details on actual gearbox condition, and the conclusions that were drawn after learning the actual damage are each discussed. The algorithms and results are summarized herein. Finally some conclusions and recommendations are provided that may help guide future tests and analysis efforts.

TI Side-band algorithm for automatic wind turbine gearbox fault detection

SO IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION

DT Article
AB Improving the availability of wind turbines is critical for minimising the cost of wind energy, especially offshore. The development of reliable and cost-effective gearbox condition monitoring systems (CMSs) is of concern to the wind industry, because the gearbox downtime has a significant effect on the wind turbine availabilities. Timely detection and diagnosis of developing gear defects is essential for minimising an unplanned downtime. One of the main limitations of most current CMSs is the time consuming and costly manual handling of large amounts of monitoring data, therefore automated algorithms would be welcome. This study presents a fault detection algorithm for incorporation into a commercial CMS for automatic gear fault detection and diagnosis. Based on the experimental evidence from the Durham Condition Monitoring Test Rig, a gear condition indicator was proposed to evaluate the gear damage during non-stationary load and speed operating conditions. The performance of the proposed technique was then successfully tested on signals from a full-size wind turbine gearbox that had sustained gear damage, and had been studied in a National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) programme. The results show that the proposed technique proves efficient and reliable for detecting gear damage. Once implemented into the wind turbine CMSs, this algorithm can automate the data interpretation, thus reducing the quantity of the information that the wind turbine operators must handle.

AB Deployment of larger scale wind turbine systems, particularly offshore, requires more organized operation and maintenance strategies to ensure systems are safe, profitable and cost-effective. Among existing maintenance strategies, reliability centred maintenance is regarded as best for offshore wind turbines, delivering corrective and proactive (i.e. preventive and predictive) maintenance techniques enabling wind turbines to achieve high availability and low cost of energy. Reliability centred maintenance analysis may demonstrate that an accurate and reliable condition monitoring system is one method to increase availability and decrease the cost of energy from wind. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop efficient and cost-effective condition monitoring techniques for wind turbines. A number of commercial wind turbine monitoring systems are available in the market, most based on existing techniques from other rotating machine industries. Other wind turbine condition monitoring reviews have been published but have not addressed the technical and commercial challenges, in particular, reliability and value for money. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap and present the wind industry with a detailed analysis of the current practical challenges with existing wind turbine condition monitoring technology.

AB A planetary gear set introduces complicated gear vibration frequency structures, especially in sequentially phased planetary gear sets. Frequency components from a fixed sensor can be enhanced and/or canceled with different planets and ring gear configurations. In this study, an amplitude modulation based formula and simple trigonometric function manipulations are used to reveal the major physical phenomena in a planetary gearbox. The formulation used in this study permits unlimited modulation indices as well as unrestricted planet passing signal responses sensed at fixed transducer locations on the gearbox. Numerical simulations and field examples are given in the end of the paper to validate the analysis. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Increasing deployment of large wind turbines (WT) offshore and in remote areas requires reliable condition monitoring (CM) techniques to guarantee the high availability of these WTs and economic return. To meet this need, much effort has been expended to improve the capability of analysing the WT CM signals. However, a fully satisfactory technique has not been achieved today. One of the major reasons is that the developed techniques still cannot provide accurate interpretation of the WT CM signals, which are usually non-linear and non-stationary in nature because of the constantly varying loads and non-linear operations of the turbines. To deal with this issue, a new data-driven signal processing technique is developed in this study based on the concepts of intrinsic time-scale decomposition (ITD) and energy operator separation algorithm (EOSA). The advantages of the proposed technique over the traditional data-driven techniques have been demonstrated and validated experimentally. It has been shown that in comparison with the Hilbert-Huang transform the combination of ITD and EOSA provided more accurate and explicit presentations of the instantaneous information of the signals tested. Thus, it provides a much improved offline tool for accurately interpreting WT CM signals.

AB Fault diagnosis is a mandatory feature in fault-tolerant systems, since it provides the information necessary for the fault isolation and system reconfiguration. Recently, permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) drives have achieved prominence in wind energy conversion systems (WECSs), due to their reliability and availability. In this paper, a new approach is proposed for current sensor fault diagnosis in PMSG drives for WECSs. As opposed to the conventional state-observer-based methods for current sensor faults, which require a system model and the respective parameters, the proposed diagnostic method uses the measured phase currents only. Thus, its main merits are simplicity and reliability in the diagnosis, making it suitable for real-time implementation and to trigger remedial procedures. In addition, current sensor and open-circuit faults can be distinguished, and the affected phase is effectively identified in both cases. The proposed diagnostic technique is applied to the two power converters of a conventional back-to-back topology, and its performance is analyzed by means of several experimental results.

AB Measurements of pitch motor torque and current give indirect information about the condition of the pitch system and can therefore potentially be used for condition-based maintenance. This paper presents an analysis of these measurements for a wind turbine, and the measurements are compared with a theoretical model based on aeroelastic simulations. The blade moment is found to have only minor influence on the friction in the blade bearing. The main factors affecting the static friction are the temperature and time after the latest pitch movement. Pitch motor current and torque are proportional at a constant pitch velocity, but the 10min maximum values are only approximately proportional, because the maximum values occur during acceleration and not simultaneously. These findings are important to consider, if using the pitch motor current or torque as an indicator for the pitch system health is considered. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A novel power curve monitoring method for wind turbines was developed to prevent a turbine failure in a wind farm. Compared with the existing methods, this algorithm automatically calculates the power curve limits for power curve monitoring, even when a considerable number of abnormal data are included in wind speed-output power data measured at a wind turbine. In addition, the proposed algorithm automatically generates an alarm message when the wind speed-power data measured at the wind turbine deviate from the power curve limits, particularly considering their degree of deviation from the power curve limits and the cases when the measured data hover between the Warning Zones and the Alarm Zones. We confirmed its effectiveness through its field tests.

AB We have carried out at laboratory test to study the feasibility of using thermal radiation detectors for online thermal monitoring of electrical systems in wind turbines. A 25 kW frequency converter is instrumented with a thermal camera, operating in the 8-14 mu m wavelength range, and a single-pixel thermopile sensor, operating in the 4-8 mu m wavelength range, to monitor the temperature development of the power electronics under various load sequences. Both systems performed satisfactorily with insignificant temperature deviations when compared to data from calibrated point contact sensor. With spatial averaging over a 7 mm x 7 mm for the camera and temporal averaging over 60 s for the thermopile sensor, we reduce the root mean square noise to 45 mK and 68 mK respectively. The low cost and simple operation of the thermopile sensor make it very attractive for condition monitoring applications, whereas the attractive feature of the camera is the possibility of multi-point or distributed temperature measurements.

AB Rapid expansion of wind turbines has drawn attention to reduce the operation and maintenance costs. Continuous condition monitoring of wind turbines allows for early detection of the generator faults, facilitating a proactive response, minimizing downtime and maximizing productivity. However, the weak features of incipient faults in wind turbines are always immersed in noises of the equipment and the environment. Wavelet denoising is a useful tool for incipient fault detection and its effect mainly depends on the feature separation and the noise elimination. Multiwavelets have two or more multiscaling functions and multiwavelet functions. They possess the properties of orthogonality, symmetry, compact support and high vanishing moments simultaneously. The data-driven block threshold selected the optimal block length and threshold at different decomposition levels by using the minimum Stein's unbiased risk estimate. A multiwavelet denoising technique with the data-driven block threshold was proposed in this paper. The simulation experiment and the feature detection of a rolling bearing with a slight inner race defect indicated that the proposed method successfully detected the weak features of incipient faults.

AB Modulations present in vibration signals generated by rotating machinery might carry a lot of useful information about objects' technical condition. It has been proven that both gearboxes and rolling element bearing (REB) faults manifest themselves as modulations. The paper describes a technique for detection of modulations in vibroacoustic signals, called modulation intensity distribution (MID), which is a function that combines multiple spectral correlation densities in one way or another, depending on the application. Additionally, the paper describes a functional obtained by integrating an MID (denoted by IMID) that has the advantage of being a function of only one frequency variable instead of two. The paper investigates the utility of the MID as an indicator for detection of the presence of rolling element bearing faults in high noise environments. For the purpose of testing, a wind turbine that suffered both advanced gearbox fault and early stage of bearing fault was chosen. Additionally, the paper undertakes the problem of application of the proposed tool in an industrial condition-monitoring system. In order to show the behavior of cyclic components generated by the turbine under study over a long period of time, the set of MIDs integrated over full range of potential carrier signals was presented as a cascade plot.

AB Wind energy has proven its viability by the emergence of countless wind turbines around the world which greatly contribute to the increased electrical generating capacity of wind farm operators. These infrastructures are usually deployed in not easily accessible areas; therefore, maintenance routines should be based on a well-guided decision so as to minimize cost. To aid operators prior to the maintenance process, a condition monitoring system should be able to accurately reflect the actual state of the wind turbine and its major components in order to execute specific preventive measures using as little resources as possible. In this paper, we propose a fault detection approach which combines cluster analysis and frequent pattern mining to accurately reflect the deteriorating condition of a wind turbine and to indicate the components that need attention. Using SCADA data, we extracted operational status patterns and developed a rule repository for monitoring wind turbine systems. Results show that the proposed scheme is able to detect the deteriorating condition of a wind turbine as well as to explicitly identify faulty components.

ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS
AB This paper presents a method of fault detection and isolation for a direct-driven wind turbine (DWT) bearing. Computed order tracking is employed to convert the non-stationary envelope signal in the time domain into a quasi-stationary signal in the angular domain by even-angle resampling. Cyclostationary demodulation is then utilized to expose the orders related to fault characteristics in the demodulation spectrum. In order to realize the automatic fault diagnosis and emit a stable alarm about bearing damage, the peak value of the demodulation spectrum is scaled and compared to a defined threshold. The significant advantage of the proposed method is the implementation of an automatic algorithm for DWT bearing diagnostics under randomly varying speed and highly alternating load. Practical applications are provided to show that the proposed approach is able to achieve reliable failure warning in the bearing condition monitoring of a DWT.

AB This paper presents a low-cost, inline, gearbox lubrication monitoring sensor. The purpose of the research was to develop a sensor that can analyze wear particles suspended in gearbox lubricant systems. Current inline sensor systems rely on methods that prevent significant morphological classification. The size and shape of the particles are often indicative of the type of wear that is occurring and is therefore significant in assessing the gearbox state. A demonstration sensor consisting of a webcam that uses an active pixel sensor combined with a rectangular cross section optically transparent acrylic pipe was developed. A rig that simulates a gearbox lubrication system was used to test the sensor. Images of wear particles suspended in the lubricant were captured in real time. Image analysis was then performed to distinguish particles from the lubricant medium. Object characteristics, such as area and major axis length, were used to determine shape parameters. It was found that the sensor could detect particles down to a major axis length of 125 mu m. Classification was also demonstrated for four basic shapes: square, circular, rectangular and ellipsoidal. ellipsoidal, was also demonstrated.

AB This article deals with the atmospheric ice accumulation on wind turbine blades and its effect on the aerodynamic performance and structural response. The role of eight atmospheric and system parameters on the ice accretion profiles was estimated using the 2D ice accumulation software lewice Twenty-four hours of icing, with time varying wind speed and atmospheric icing conditions, was simulated on a rotor. Computational fluid dynamics code, FLUENT, was used to estimate the aerodynamic coefficients of the blade after icing. The results were also validated against wind tunnel measurements performed at LM Wind Power using a NACA64618 airfoil. The effects of changes in geometry and surface roughness are considered in the simulation. A blade element momentum code WT-Perf is then used to quantify the degradation in performance curves. The dynamic responses of the wind turbine under normal and iced conditions were simulated with the wind turbine aeroelastic code HAWC2. The results show different behaviors below and above rated wind speeds. In below rated wind speed, for a 5MW virtual NREL wind turbine, power loss up to 35% is observed, and the rated power is shifted from wind speed of 11 to 19ms(-1). However, the thrust of the iced rotor in below rated wind speed is smaller than the clean rotor up to 14%, but after rated wind speed, it is up to 40% bigger than the clean rotor. Finally, it is briefly indicated how the results of this paper can be used for condition monitoring and ice detection. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI S-Transform and its contribution to wind turbine condition monitoring

DT Article
DE Wind turbine; Condition monitoring; S-transform; Principal component
   analysis
ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; LOCALIZATION
AB Condition monitoring (CM) has long been recognised as one of the best methods of reducing the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of wind turbines (WTs). However, its potential in the wind industry has not been fully exploited. One of the major reasons is due to the lack of an efficient tool to properly process the WT CM signals, which are usually non-stationary in both time and frequency domains owing to the constantly varying operational and loading conditions experienced by WTs. For this reason, S-transform and its potential contribution to WT CM are researched in this paper. Following the discussion of the superiorities of S-transform to the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Wavelet Transform, two S-transform based CM techniques are developed, dedicated for use on WTs. One is for tracking the energy variations of those fault-related characteristic frequencies under varying operational conditions (the energy rise of these frequencies usually indicates the presence of a fault); another is for assessing the health condition of WT gears and bearings, which have shown significant reliability issues in both onshore and offshore wind projects. In the paper, both proposed techniques have been verified experimentally, showing that they are valid for detecting both the mechanical and electrical faults occurring in the WT despite its varying operational and loading conditions.

AB As the use of wind power has steadily increased, the importance of a condition monitoring and fault diagnosis system is being emphasized to maximize the availability and reliability of wind turbines. To develop novel algorithms for fault detection and lifespan estimation, a wind turbine simulator is indispensible for verification of the proposed algorithms before introducing them into a health monitoring and integrity diagnosis system. In this paper, a new type of simulator is proposed to develop and verify advanced diagnosis algorithms. The simulator adopts a torque control method for a motor and inverter to realize variable speed-variable pitch control strategies. Unlike conventional motor-generator configurations, the simulator includes several kinds of components and a variety of sensors. Specifically, it has similarity to a 3 MW wind turbine, thereby being able to acquire a state of operation that closely resembles that of the actual 3 MW wind turbine operated at various wind conditions. This paper presents the design method for the simulator and its control logic. The experimental comparison between the behavior of the simulator and that of a wind turbine shows that the proposed control logic performs successfully and the dynamic behaviors of the simulator have similar trends as those of the wind turbine.

AB Reliability and availability of modern wind turbines are of increasing importance, for two reasons. The first is due to the fact that power grids around in the world depends at a higher and higher degree on wind energy, and the second is the importance of lowering Cost of Energy of the wind turbines. One of the critical components in modern wind turbines is the gearbox. Failures in the gearbox are costly both due to the cost of the gearbox itself, but also due to lost power generation during repair of it. Wind turbine gearboxes are consequently monitored by condition monitoring systems operating in parallel with the control system, and also uses additional sensors measuring different accelerations and noises, etc. In this paper gearbox data from high fidelity gearbox model of a 750 kW wind turbine gearbox, simulated with and without faults are used to shown the potential of frequency based detection schemes applied on measurements normally available in a wind controller system. This paper shows that two given faults in the gearbox can be detected using a frequency based detection approach applied to sensor signals normally available in the wind turbine control system. This means that gearbox condition monitoring/ fault detection could be included in the standard control system, which potentially can remove the cost of the additional condition monitoring system and the additional sensors used in it.

AB Effective vibration based condition monitoring applied to the planetary stage of a wind turbine gearbox has been historically difficult. Numerous complications associated with the low speed and variable speed nature of a wind turbine gearbox as well as the many sources of vibration signal modulation and poor vibration transmission paths within the planetary stage itself have presented complex challenges around effectively monitoring the health of planetary stage components. The focus of this paper is the vibration behavior of planetary stage gear related damage and how this behavior can be accurately identified using vibration data. The theory behind this behavior and a case history showing the successful detection of planet gear damage and ring gear damage is presented. The damage detailed in this case is clearly identifiable in the data provided by the ADAPT.Wind condition monitoring system. Although this type of damage requires a gearbox replacement, prompt detection is important to avoid the risk of splitting the gearbox casing and damaging additional wind turbine components.

AB This paper presents a cost benefit analysis for wind turbine condition monitoring systems. It is widely acknowledged that performing proactive maintenance actions can reduce the number and severity of wind turbine failures. However, the use of condition monitoring systems to determine the health of the system is often viewed as costly and of little financial benefit. In this analysis the increased costs associated with condition monitoring were offset by the positive effect of early fault detection, with faults being detected before they reach a critical stage. The continual growth in turbine output and the emergence of far-offshore wind farm sites make the economic case for cost of energy reduction from timely and accurate fault detection ever stronger.
   An assessment of the capability of the monitoring system was undertaken through allowance for the true to false condition monitoring detection ratio and the ability of the system to detect the severity of a fault. The analysis also compared onshore and offshore assets where the access availability can severely influence the downtime.
   The results show a clear financial justification for wind turbine condition monitoring and indicate the successful detection ratio required before a condition monitoring system can offer a financial benefit.

AB In a modern wind turbine, the gearbox is an expensive and fault-prone subsystem. Currently, condition monitoring, based on comparison of data of healthy baseline measurement and online measurement, followed by feature analysis and decision making, is the main approach of diagnosis and prognosis. Although having been employed in many practical implementations, such methods have limitations. For example, a huge database is needed when operating conditions change and normal variations are significant. Traditionally, first-principle-based modeling of gearboxes is considered very challenging, primarily due to their dynamic characteristics that exhibit time-periodicity and encompass a very wide frequency range. In this research, aiming at achieving the predictive modeling capability, a lumped-parameter model of a two-stage laboratory gearbox testbed is constructed based on the assumed mode method. This model can characterize the gearbox dynamic effects including the time-varying mesh stiffness and backlash. The Floquet theory and harmonic balance method are then applied to analytically investigate the system dynamics, where the eigenvalues of the time-periodic gearbox are extracted and correlated to the spectral analysis results of the time-domain response prediction. This modeling approach and the associated analysis lay down a foundation for establishing hybrid dynamic model of complex gearbox systems which will further be utilized in model-based diagnosis and prognosis.

AB As a type of clean and renewable energy source, wind power is growing fast as more and more countries lay emphasis on it. At the end of 2011, the global wind energy capacity reached 238 GW, with a cumulative growth of more than 20% per year, which is certainly a respectable figure for any industry. There is an exigent need to reduce the costs of operating and maintaining wind turbines while they became one of the fastest growing sources of power production in the world today.
   Gearbox is a critical component in the transmission system of wind turbine generator. Wind turbine gearbox operates in the extreme conditions of heavy duty, low speed and non-stationary load and speed, etc., which makes it one of the components that have high failure rate. To detect the fault of gearbox, many methods have been developed, including vibration analysis, acoustic emission, oil analysis, temperature monitoring, and performance monitoring and so on. Vibration analysis is widely used in fault diagnosis process and many efforts have been made in this area. However, there are many challenging problems in detecting the failure of wind turbine gearbox. The gearbox transforms low-speed revolutions from the rotor to high-speed revolutions, for example, from 20 rpm to 1500 rpm or higher. Usually one or more planetary gear stages are adopted in a gearbox design because the load can be shared by several planet gears and the transmission ratio can get higher. One disadvantage with the planetary gear stage is that a more complex design makes the detection and specification of gearbox failure difficult. The existing fault diagnosis theory and technology for fixed-shaft gearbox cannot solve the issues in the fault diagnosis of planetary gearbox.
   The planetary stage of wind turbine gearbox consists of sun gear, ring gear and several planet gears. The planet gears not only rotate around their own centers but also revolve around the sun gear center, and the distance between each planet gear to the sensor varies all the time. This adds complexity to vibration signals and results in difficulty in finding the fault-related features. The paths through which the vibration propagates from its origin to the sensors are complex, and the gears of other stage vibrate at the same time. This makes fault features be buried in noises. Further, the extreme conditions of heavy duty, low speed, and non-stationary workload lead to evidently non-stationary phenomena in the collected vibration. Methods to assess fault severity of a gearbox should be developed so as to realize fault prognosis and estimate of the remaining useful life of gearbox. Finally, other issues like signal analysis based on multi-sensor data fusion are also considered.
   This paper gives a comprehensive investigation on the state-of-the-art development in the wind turbine gearbox condition monitoring and health evaluation. The general situation of wind energy industry is discussed, and the research progresses in each aspects of wind turbine gearbox are reviewed. The existing problems in the current research are summarized in the end.

AB Wind turbine maintenance is emerging as an unexpectedly high component of turbine operating cost and there is an increasing interest in managing this cost. Here, we present an alternative view of maintenance as a value-driver, and develop an optimization algorithm to maximize the value delivered by maintenance. We model the stochastic deterioration of the turbine in two dimensions: the deterioration rate, and the extent. of deterioration, and view maintenance as an operator that moves the turbine to an improved state in which it can generate more power and so earn more revenue. We then use a standard net present value (NPV) approach to calculate the value of the turbine by deducting the costs incurred in the installation, operations and maintenance from the revenue due to the power generation. The application of our model is demonstrated using several scenarios with a focus on blade deterioration. We evaluate the value delivered by implementing blade condition monitoring systems (CMS). A higher fidelity CMS allows the blade state to be determined with higher precision. With this improved state information, an optimal maintenance strategy can be derived. The difference between the value of the turbine with and without CMS can be interpreted as the value of the CMS. The results indicate that a higher fidelity (and more expensive) condition monitoring system (CMS) does not necessarily yield the highest value, and, that there is an optimal level of fidelity that results in maximum value. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, it is a practical approach to wind turbine valuation and operation that takes operating and market conditions into account. This work should therefore be useful to wind farm operators and investors. Second, it shows how the value of a CMS can be explicitly assessed. This work should therefore be useful to CMS manufacturers and wind farm operators.

AB The gearbox oil and the wind turbine gearbox condition are correlated. The oil can give the wind turbine operator the necessary information to plan maintenance and avoid costly repairs. Therefore, a test bench that can reproduce the gearbox operating conditions would be necessary to test oil-sensors. This paper presents a first testing approach using a Highly Accelerated Life Test / Highly Accelerated Stress Screening test chamber. It allows assessing the performance of oil properties sensors under extreme ambient temperature and vibration levels, based on measurements from a wind turbine gearbox. Results from a test on an oil properties sensor are presented and discussed. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID DOMAIN
AB Doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) are the most popular configuration met in the wind energy sector occupying approximately 6 5 % of the total market share. Condition monitoring of wind turbine generators is performed based on vibration data collected from accelerometers mounted on the drive end and non-drive end bearings, meeting the requirements of numerous turbine operators for condition based maintenance. In a DFIG the voltage applied to the rotor is controlled by a converter, where electric connection between the two is accomplished by using slip rings. Improper connection between the slip ring unit and the rotor circuit is manifested as excessive vibration seen in both ends of the generator. The consistent and accurate diagnosis of a rotor circuit malfunction is of crucial importance in regards to proper troubleshooting of the fault and the overall health of the generator. In this paper generator bearing vibration signature for a DFIG under operation with one rotor phase coil open is analysed and presented. Further this failure mode is compared to rotor dynamics fault, such as rotational looseness, and the difference in signature is discussed. Vibration data from a multi-mega watt DFIG wind turbine subjected to the above described failure mode is illustrated as scalar values and frequency spectra. It is shown that detailed analyses have resulted in a successful identification of disconnected rotor phase by detecting sidebands around the generator running speed harmonics matching the pole pass frequency.

AB Asset management of wind turbines has gained increased importance in recent years. High maintenance cost and longer downtimes of wind turbines have led to research in methods to optimize maintenance activities. Condition monitoring systems have proven to be a useful tool towards aiding maintenance management of wind turbines. Methods using Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system along with artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been developed to monitor the condition of wind turbine components. Various researchers have presented different artificial neural network (ANN) based models for condition monitoring of components in a wind turbine. This paper presents an application of the approach to decide and update the training data set needed to create an accurate ANN model. A case study with SCADA data from a real wind turbine has been presented. The results show that due to a major maintenance activity, like replacement of component, the ANN model has to be re-trained. The results show that application of the proposed approach makes it possible to update and re-train the ANN model.

AB Maintenance costs for wind power plants are a significant part of the total life cycle cost, especially for offshore wind power plants, situated at remote sites. In order to decrease the cost of maintenance, monitoring systems have been used to estimate the condition of critical components in wind turbines. This paper proposes Life Cycle Cost analysis (LCC) approach for maintenance management of wind turbines. The LCC approach for maintenance management presented in this paper is an extension on previous work by J. Nilsson and L. Bertling, where a comparison has been made with this previous work and the same is extended with new data and models. Case studies are presented based on data from three different wind turbinesrated 3 and 6MW. Three different scenarios have been studied and the effect of condition monitoring system (CMS) has been analysed. For any chosen value the CMS proves to be a profitable option.

AB Wind power is one of the fastest growing renewable energy sources. Wind turbine blades and heights have been increased steadily in the last 10 years in order to increase the capacity of wind power generator. So, the amount of wind turbine energy is increased by increasing the capacity of wind turbine generator, but the preventive, corrective and replacement maintenance cost is increased by that's reasons. Recently, Condition Monitoring System (CMS) can repair the fault and diagnose of wind turbine that introduce to solve these problems. However, these systems have a problem that cannot predict and diagnose of the wind turbine faults. In this paper, wind turbine fault prediction methodology is proposed by using the SVM method. In the case study, wind turbine fault and external environmental factors are analysed by using the SVM method.

AB Wind power becomes one of the most important cleaner energy in the world. The maintenance problem becomes the main factor preventing the appropriate power price which can be accepted by people. So, many researches contribute to improve the availability of wind farms. Traditionally, most researchers paid attention to the fault diagnosis, prognosis and maintenance strategies optimization to short the down time and the maintenance cost. But they all neglect the condition monitoring work of repaired gearbox of wind turbine before it is delivered to the customer from maintenance center to the wind farm. The life of repaired gearbox is also a very critical factor which influences the availability of wind farm. Good checking methods and good standard can provide a good support of good performance after the gearbox installed on the up tower. So, this paper proposed how to address these issues.

AB We propose a fiber Bragg grating laser sensor system for possible uses in large scale wind turbine blades' condition monitoring. The measurement instability due to the sensitive multi-wavelength lasing has been greatly improved by employing a polarization scrambling in the lasing cavity and a spectrometer demodulator. With suggested technique, we obtained 100% of data acquisition rate from all the 4 FBG laser sensors along single fiber-optic cable. Also the noise characteristics of the sensor outputs have improved 4 times more than the previous system.

AB Wind turbine towers are in need of condition monitoring so as to lower the cost of unexpected maintenance. Wind loading from turbulence and gusts can cause damage in horizontal axis wind turbines even the supporting towers. Monitoring of wind turbines in service using embedded data sensor arrays usually is not targeted at the turbine-tower interaction from the perspective of structural dynamics. In this study the remote monitoring of the tower supporting a horizontal-axis wind turbine was attempted using a microwave interferometer. The dominant frequency of one tower was found to be decreased by more than 20% in 16 months. Numerical modeling using spectral finite elements is in progress and should provide further information regarding frequency shift due to stiffness variation and added mass. Expected outcome will contribute to remote monitoring procedures and nondestructive evaluation techniques for local wind turbine structures during operation.

AB The blades are crucial components of a wind turbine, and its steady and reliable operation is directly related to the power output. Thus, condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of the wind turbine blades is highly beneficial to the operational cost. This paper presents a study of small horizontal axis wind turbine blade rotational speed measurement by laser Doppler velocimeter based on dual-core photonic crystal fiber (DC-PCF). The theory on the DC-PCF Doppler velocimeter is presented, and the measurement system is designed and tested. Experimental results show that the DC-PCF Doppler velocimeter has been proved to work successfully. The uncertainty of the rotational speed is about 0 similar to 4 rpm. The accuracy can meet the requirements for monitoring the rotational operation of the wind turbine.

AB For wind farms, wind turbine condition monitoring is important to reduce maintenance costs and improve the competitiveness in the electricity market, particularly for offshore wind farms. This paper seeks to establish wind turbine gearbox temperature model under the normal working state using Gaussian process, the forecast and evaluation of temperature is also described. Within the Bayesian context, the paper aims to training Gaussian process, using the maximum likelihood optimized approach to find the optimal hyperparameters. For large-scale regression tasks, a novel method using Cholesky decomposition to avoid ill-conditioned matrix is described. Another method using matrix caching to speed up the inverse of matrix calculation is proposed. In addition, the optimized Gaussian model is used to predict the gearbox validation data and compare with SVM (support vector machine) and BPNN (neural network) this two methods. By comparing the simulation results, Gaussian process gearbox temperature model demonstrates higher prediction accuracy. The model is a valuable object for condition monitoring.

AB It is important that the impact of the offshore environment on wind turbine reliability is reduced significantly due to the importance of offshore wind deployment to global energy targets. Future development may otherwise be compromised by unsustainable operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. This paper aims to improve the accuracy of offshore O&M models by accounting for any relationship between certain weather characteristics and wind turbine failure modes. This is done using maintenance data from a UK onshore wind farm and weather data from a weather station located nearby. Non-parametric Mixture Models are estimated from the data and they are used to calculate a more accurate, weather dependent, failure rate which will be used in future research for Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation. This research will be of particular interest to wind turbine operators and manufacturers.

AB Wind turbine condition monitoring is essential task in the process of maintaining machine operation at the optimal level. It is related to ensuring the profitability of investment and the provision of security in the environment of the turbine. However, operational conditions of turbine associated with non-stationary nature of the stimulus which is the wind, impede the correct diagnosis of the machine. In addition, a multitude of parameters adversely affects the clarity of predictions and setting alarm thresholds. In the article, the authors evaluate the impact of generator output power and rotational speed on selected vibration-based feature value. The study was performed for wind turbine planetary gearbox during fault development of the ring. It was possible due to historical data consisting peak-to-peak (P2P) values together with corresponding values of rotational speed and generator output power. For the purpose of the experiment the method that bases on calculation of arithmetic mean of the data in the segments corresponding to the chosen ranges of both rotational speed and generator output power is presented. Results are given in the form of three-dimensional charts, which allow assessing the impact of parameters on the studied feature. The paper shows that for machinery operating under varying regime proposed representation might serve as a valuable method for fault detection. Additionally, authors highlight the importance of analysis of vibration-based features as a function of two variables (rotational speed and power/load).

DE Machine operational states; Condition monitoring of machinery working
   under non-stationary parameters
AB A reliable evaluation of technical condition of machinery working under non-stationary conditions requires a rigorous tracking of operational parameters. Therefore, modern condition monitoring systems (CMS) enable reading and registering of process parameters (e. g. speed, load, pressure, etc.) in parallel with acquisition of vibroacoustic signals. Although few tries have been undertaken to develop state-free analysis of vibration signals, currently installed systems still do rely on state-preclassified data. The paper shows how the process, referential data might be automatically transformed into proposition of optimal machine operational states in terms of their number and their range. As indicated by the title, the paper shows common pitfalls coming from implementation of popular clustering approach. The proposed algorithm illustrates is verified on real data from a pitch-controlled wind turbine.

   mining
AB The monitoring of wind energy production is fundamental to improve the performances of a wind farm during the operational phase. In order to perform reliable operational analysis, data mining of all available information spreading out from turbine control systems is required. In this work a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data analysis was performed on a small wind farm and new post-processing methods are proposed for condition monitoring of the aero-generators. Indicators are defined to detect the malfunctioning of a wind turbine and to select meaningful data to investigate the causes of the anomalous behaviour of a turbine. The operating state database is used to collect information about the proper power production of a wind turbine, becoming a tool that can be used to verify if the contractual obligations between the original equipment manufacturer and the wind farm operator are met. Results demonstrate that a proper selection of the SCADA data can be very useful to measure the real performances of a wind farm and thus to define optimal repair/replacement and preventive maintenance policies that play a major role in case of energy production.

AB Operational Modal Analysis (OMA), also known as output-only modal analysis, allows identifying modal parameters only by using the response measurements of the structures in operational conditions when the input forces cannot be measured. These information can then be used to improve numerical models in order to monitor the operating and structural conditions of the system. This is a critical aspect both for condition monitoring and maintenance of large wind turbines, particularly in the off-shore sector where operation and maintenance represent a high percentage of total costs. Although OMA is widely applied, the wind turbine case still remains an open issue. Numerical aeroelastic models could be used, once they have been validated, to introduce virtual damages to the structures in order to analyze the generated data. Results from such models can then be used as baseline to monitor the operating and structural condition of the machine.

AB Wind energy is a renewable energy that growing fast across the whole world, but its subsystems experience premature failures during its 20-year design life, leading downtime and costly maintain and repair. Since gearbox is the subsystem who causes the longest downtime, condition monitoring (CM) of the gearbox to prevent catastrophic failures is critical to wind energy. Based on vibration analysis, this paper presents a practical CM technique for faulty gear and faulty bearing detection of wind turbine gearbox. The algorithms studied in this paper have been successfully applied on signals from a field test of a full-size wind turbine gearbox who sustained gear and bearing damage, showing a good engineering prospect.

AB Order tracking analysis has been demonstrated to be suitable for wind turbine gearbox fault diagnosis, but in traditional way, a keyphasor signal is indispensable. In some real cases, due to harsh working environment and installation space limitation, it's hard to acquire this keyphasor signal. To overcome this problem, raw speed profile is used in this paper to synthesize the keyphasor, by assuming that the first pulse signal is at time zero, once the arriving time of the ith pulse is known, calculate the next pulse arrival time in two different ways, then minimizing the difference of these two results to get the next pulse arrival time. By assuming the shaft angular acceleration is constant between three consecutive pulses and using the synthesized keyphasor above, this paper successfully fulfill order tracking analysis on a United Stated MW-class wind turbine gearbox without keyphasor signal, which shows a very good engineering practicability.

AB Due to the increase in the number of failures in the wind turbine generators, the condition monitoring system plays a significant role in overcoming the negative effects resulting from the difficult operation conditions. Mechanical and electrical properties can be combined to detect the faults coming from wind turbine generators by analyzing their behavior under different (normal and abnormal) operation conditions. Studying the trend and effect of the electrical torque pulsations on wind turbine generators under different conditions allows for a proper condition monitoring. In this paper, different methodology has been adopted to develop a proper condition monitoring system on the wind generators by evaluating the generator electrical torque based on mechanical torque and taking into account the acceleration torque, which has not been considered in previous work. Using the electric torque with respect to the rotor angular speed of the generator, when it is running under different operation conditions, indicates the generator health, which is the main methodology of the proposed work. A case study, which is based upon collected data from actual measurements, is presented in this work in order to demonstrate the adequacy of the proposed model.

AB This paper focuses on the theoretical analysis of wind turbine radar signatures in the near-field. This is a first step towards the development of a close-range radar system which can detect, and potentially classify wind turbine structural faults. A simplified theoretical model of the wind turbine radar signature under such conditions is presented, which relates radar signal parameters to actual wind turbine mechanical properties. The theoretical model is experimentally confirmed using scaled turbine models in an anechoic chamber.

TI Wind turbine condition monitoring based on SCADA data using normal

AB This paper is part two of a two part series. The originality of part one was the proposal of a novelty approach for wind turbine supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data mining for condition monitoring purposes. The novelty concerned the usage of adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference system (ANFIS) models in this context and the application of a proposed procedure to a wide range of different SCADA signals. The applicability of the set up ANFIS models for anomaly detection was proven by the achieved performance of the models. In combination with the fuzzy interference system (FIS) proposed the prediction errors provide information about the condition of the monitored components.
   Part two presents application examples illustrating the efficiency of the proposed method. The work is based on continuously measured wind turbine SCADA data from 18 modern type pitch regulated wind turbines of the 2 MW class covering a period of 35 months. Several real life faults and issues in this data are analyzed and evaluated by the condition monitoring system (CMS) and the results presented. It is shown that SCADA data contain crucial information for wind turbine operators worth extracting. Using full signal reconstruction (FSRC) adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference system (ANFIS) normal behavior models (NBM) in combination with fuzzy logic (FL) a setup is developed for data mining of this information. A high degree of automation can be achieved. It is shown that FL rules established with a fault at one turbine can be applied to diagnose similar faults at other turbines automatically via the CMS proposed. A further focus in this paper lies in the process of rule optimization and adoption, allowing the expert to implement the gained knowledge in fault analysis. The fault types diagnosed here are: (1) a hydraulic oil leakage; (2) cooling system filter obstructions; (3) converter fan malfunctions; (4) anemometer offsets and (5) turbine controller malfunctions. Moreover, the graphical user interface (GUI) developed to access, analyze and visualize the data and results is presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Online condition monitoring is a crucial task for wind turbine generators availability and reliability enhancement and leads to an early electrical and mechanical faults detection which can reduce the maintenance cost and avoids catastrophic failures. The performance of any condition monitoring system should be evaluated before its installation on an actual full-scale system. Therefore, the design of a reduced-scale wind turbine generator including its main subsystem components at initial stage is important for the assessment of new methods dedicated to electrical and mechanical faults prediction and detection in wind turbine generators. This paper aims to develop a test bench to accomplish this goal. A doubly-fed wound rotor induction generator configuration is selected since it is the dominate technology currently used in the market. The system includes required instrumentations as well as a real-time platform for development of any sophisticated condition monitoring strategy devoted to online condition monitoring of main parts of a wind turbine generator.

AB Nowadays, the importance of real time condition monitoring and control for wind turbine (WT) is increasing because WTs are installed on remote site such as mountains and offshore. In this paper, we implement a monitoring and control system for a small-scale wind turbine. The monitoring and control system consists of data collection units, control unit and coordinator. The data collection units collect data from various sensors: temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind direction, wind speed and vibration. And the data collection units transmit sensing data to a coordinator. A ZigBee is used to communicate between a coordinator and data collection units. The coordinator is also communicate with PC and smart device through RS232 and Bluetooth, respectively. The GUI is implemented based on Android and LabVIEW to show the sensing data. The GUI based on LabVIEW can control the wind turbine direction using control unit.

AB For wind farms, the relationship between wind speed and output can be described by power curve of wind turbines, and it is an important embodiment of power performance of wind turbines. Based on the mathematical model of the power curve of wind turbine, monitoring performance of the wind turbine can be designed. Power curve model of wind turbines can be established by using Gaussian process. Within the Bayesian context, the paper aims to train the Gaussian process by using the maximum likelihood optimized approach to find the optimal hyperparameters. The model was validated by the data. Finally, based on the wind turbine power curve mathematical model, the states of the wind turbine can be monitored by using the technology of control charts.

AB Bearings consist one of the most widely used industrial rotating machine elements, especially rolling bearings and journal bearings. The capability to detect fast, accurately and easily the existence and severity of bearing fault during operation is very important as an unexpected failure of machine can lead to significant economic losses. This paper mainly introduces an actual case study of bearing condition monitoring in industry. As an effective tool in inspection the bearing condition, shock pulse method (SPM) is utilized to monitor the bearings of test rig which includes an electric motor and a wind turbine. Through analysing the frequency spectrum derived from the SPM instrument, the faulty bearing is located accurately. The case study validates that SPM is quite effective for monitoring the bearings condition in industrial applications.

AB Wind energy conversion is the fastest growing source of electricity generation in the world among the other renewable energy production technologies. Whereas investment costs have decreased over years, operational and maintenance costs of wind turbines are still high, thus attracting the focus of researchers and industrial operators.
   Classical maintenance techniques, i.e.: run-to-failure and scheduled-preventive maintenance, are still dominant in this sector; however, condition monitoring has gained space in the wind turbine market and new diagnostic methods and techniques are continuously being proposed. Condition monitoring techniques seem the most effective tools to minimize operational and maintenance costs and reduce downtimes by early detection of faults.
   This paper is aimed at reviewing the state of the art of condition monitoring for horizontal axis wind turbines. After a brief introduction presenting the current trends in the market of wind energy, the paper reviews the most common failure modes of wind turbines and the traditional approach to maintenance. The core of this study details the state of the art in the field of system architectures, sensors and signal processing techniques for the diagnostic of faults in wind turbine components. Finally, some general conclusions are drawn on the overall trends in the field of condition monitoring of wind turbines.

AB Condition monitoring of a wind turbine is important to extend the wind turbine system's reliability and useful life. However, in many cases, to extract feature components becomes challenging and the applicability of information drops down due to the large amount of noise. Stochastic resonance (SR), used as a method of utilising noise to amplify weak signals in nonlinear systems, can detect weak signals overwhelmed in the noise. Therefore, a new noise-controlled second-order enhanced SR method based on the Morlet wavelet transform is proposed to extract fault feature for wind turbine vibration signals in the present study. The second-order SR method can obtain better denoising effect and higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of resonance output by means of twice integral transform compared with the traditional SR method. Morlet wavelet transform can obtain finer frequency partitions and overcome the frequency aliasing compared with the classical wavelet transform. Therefore, through Morlet wavelet transform, the noise intensity of different scales can be adjusted to realize the resonance detection of weak periodic signal whatever it is a low-frequency signal or high-frequency signal. Thus the method is well-suited for enhancement of weak fault identification, whose effectiveness has been verified by the practical vibration signals carrying fault information. Finally, the proposed method has been applied to extract feature of the looseness fault of shaft coupling of wind turbine successfully. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID DESIGN
AB Renewable energy sources especially wind energy have gained much attention due to the recent energy crisis and the urge to obtain clean energy. To maintain the wind turbine in operation healthily, implementation of condition monitoring system and fault detection system is necessary. In wind turbine condition monitoring, vibration analysis is a common and affective way to apply in the feature extraction and fault diagnosis, especially in the rotation parts. The blade-cabin-tower coupling system is analyzed in this paper. At first, the coordinate system and the kinetic equation are established. The tower natural frequency is calculated based on the coordinate system and the random following wind vibration is analyzed. In the end, the total wind force in blade-cabin-tower coupling system is solved. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DRIVE SYSTEMS; MACHINES
AB Increasing the availability of multi-megawatt wind turbines (WT) is necessary if the cost of energy generated by wind is to be reduced. It has been found that WT generator bearings have a surprisingly high failure rate, with failures happening too early to be due to classical rolling contact fatigue. One potentially important root cause of bearings failures, bearing currents, has been investigated in this paper. The use of pulse-width modulated power electronic converters in variable speed WTs results in the presence of a common-mode voltage which may drive stray currents through a parasitic circuit in the generator structure. In this paper it is shown that if appropriate mitigation strategies are not employed, the bearing lubricant may experience electric stress in excess of its dielectric strength resulting in electrostatic discharge machining (EDM) of the bearing. Moreover it is shown that rotor-fed machines are more susceptible than stator-fed machines due to the presence of a larger coupling capacitance in the stray circuit. This is significant due to the prevalence of doubly fed induction generator WTs. The need for further research in this area, particularly in order to quantify the damage caused by EDM and develop diagnostic and prognostic techniques for the application of condition monitoring to this phenomenon, has been demonstrated.

AB Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are currently considered crucial means to increase the reliability and availability of wind turbines and, consequently, to reduce the wind energy cost. With similar goals, direct-drive wind turbines based on permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) with full-scale power converters are an emerging and promising technology. Numerous studies show that power converters are a significant contributor to the overall failure rate of modern wind turbines. In this context, open-circuit fault diagnosis in the two power converters of a PMSG drive for wind turbine applications is addressed in this paper. A diagnostic method is proposed for each power converter, allowing real-time detection and localization of multiple open-circuit faults. The proposed methods are suitable for integration into the drive controller and triggering remedial actions. In order to prove the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnostic methods, several simulation and experimental results are presented.

AB Increasing deployment of wind turbines requires efficient condition monitoring to ensure the safety and availability of these machines. Grid code also requests the operator to enhance the monitoring of the quality of the power generated by the wind turbine. Most commercially available wind turbine condition monitoring systems are supported by a number of vibration transducers. They consequently are complex in hardware, expensive in price, but inefficient in computation and particularly lack of power quality monitoring ability. In view of this, an innovative electrical signal analysis-based wind turbine condition and power quality monitoring technique is developed in this paper by the approach of individual harmonic extraction. The proposed technique has been verified in the lab by applying to detecting both the mechanical and electrical faults emulated on a specially designed wind turbine condition monitoring test rig. Experiments show that the proposed technique is not only sensitive to the faults, but alert to the degradation of power quality.

AB Latest development of distributed condition monitoring for heavy duty machinery has revealed a major challenge concerning reliable data acquisition. Due to frequent failures of diagnostic algorithms caused by incorrectly registered data, validation of vibration signals became a very attractive field of research. The paper shows how classical data acquisition procedures might be enhanced by implementation of signal validation methods based on both machine process parameters signals and machine vibration signals. Presented validation covers analysis of process parameters, data stability constrains and also independent and comparative validation of vibration signals. Benefits of applied techniques are illustrated on real data from a wind turbine. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Four data-mining approaches for wind turbine power curve monitoring are compared. Power curve monitoring can be applied to evaluate the turbine power output and detect deviations, causing financial loss. In this research, cluster center fuzzy logic, neural network, and kappa-nearest neighbor models are built and their performance compared against literature. Recently developed adaptive neuro-fuzzy-interference system models are set up and their performance compared with the other models, using the same data. Literature models often neglect the influence of the ambient temperature and the wind direction. The ambient temperature can influence the power output up to 20%. Nearby obstacles can lower the power output for certain wind directions. The approaches proposed in literature and the ANFIS models are compared by using wind speed only and two additional inputs. The comparison is based on the mean absolute error, root mean squared error, mean absolute percentage error, and standard deviation using data coming from three pitch regulated turbines rating 2 MW each. The ability to highlight performance deviations is investigated by use of real measurements. The comparison shows the decrease of error rates and of the ANFIS models when taking into account the two additional inputs and the ability to detect faults earlier.

AB Offshore wind energy is catching increasing worldwide interest. However, access and maintenance offshore can be difficult and will be more costly than onshore, and hence, availability is correspondingly lower. As a result, there is a growing interest in wind turbine condition monitoring with condition-based rather than responsive and scheduled maintenance. A non-linear state estimation technique (NSET) model is presented here to model a healthy wind turbine gearbox using stored historical data. These data capture the inter-relationship between the model input and output parameters. The state vectors comprising the data should cover as much as turbine operational range, including the extreme conditions in order to obtain an accurate model performance. A model so constructed can be applied to assess the operational data. Welch's t-test is employed in the fault detection algorithm, together with suitable time series filtering, to identify incipient anomalies in the turbine gearbox before they develop into catastrophic faults. Two case studies based on 10-minute supervisory control and data acquisition data from a commercial wind farm are presented to demonstrate the model's effectiveness. Comparison is made with neural network modelling, and the NSET approach is demonstrated to be superior.

AB The study of pollution performance on a wind turbine blade due to lightning is important, as it can cause major damage to wind turbine blades. In the present work, optical emission spectroscopy (OES) technique is used to understand the influence of pollutant deposited on a wind turbine blade in an off-shore environment. A methodical experimental study was carried out by adopting IEC 60507 standards, and it was observed that the lightning discharge propagates at the interface between the pollutant and the glass fiber reinforced plastic (Material used in manufacturing of wind turbine blades). In addition, as a diagnostic condition monitoring technique, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is proposed and demonstrated to rank the severity of pollutant on the wind turbine blades from a remote area. Optical emission spectra observed during surface discharge process induced by lightning impulse voltage is in agreement with the spectra observed during LIBS.

AB Certain parts of a wind turbine, for example, the gearbox require significant time and heavy lifting equipment in the event of catastrophic failure necessitating replacement. Continuous condition monitoring has the potential to catch problems early, enable scheduled preventative maintenance and thereby reduce turbine downtime, reduce the number of site visits and prevent secondary damage. Accelerometers applied to mechanical components of the drive train are traditionally used for condition monitoring, but require their own data acquisition system and analysis software. In contrast, the electrical current and voltage are continuously measured and could also be used for condition monitoring more cheaply. An experimental data acquisition system has been installed on a small (25 kW) onshore turbine in Leicestershire, UK to compare three-phase currents and voltages on the stator windings with six accelerometer signals. Data have been recorded before and after a gearbox failure and replacement. Data were analysed using both Fourier transform and Morlet continuous wavelet transform methods. Results show that the stator voltages show the same radial and axial mode vibration frequencies as the accelerometers, and could therefore be used for condition monitoring. Furthermore, the stator currents show torsional modes of vibration not picked up by the accelerometers.

AB Concerns amongst wind turbine (WT) operators about gearbox reliability arise from complex repair procedures, high replacement costs and long downtimes leading to revenue losses. Therefore, reliable monitoring for the detection, diagnosis and prediction of such faults are of great concerns to the wind industry. Monitoring of WT gearboxes has gained importance as WTs become larger and move to more inaccessible locations. This paper summarizes typical WT gearbox failure modes and reviews supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and condition monitoring system (CMS) approaches for monitoring them. It then presents two up-to-date monitoring case studies, from different manufacturers and types of WT, using SCADA and CMS signals.
   The first case study, applied to SCADA data, starts from basic laws of physics applied to the gearbox to derive robust relationships between temperature, efficiency, rotational speed and power output. The case study then applies an analysis, based on these simple principles, to working WTs using SCADA oil temperature rises to predict gearbox failure.
   The second case study focuses on CMS data and derives diagnostic information from gearbox vibration amplitudes and oil debris particle counts against energy production from working WTs.
   The results from the two case studies show how detection, diagnosis and prediction of incipient gearbox failures can be carried out using SCADA and CMS signals for monitoring although each technique has its particular strengths. It is proposed that in the future, the wind industry should consider integrating WT SCADA and CMS data to detect, diagnose and predict gearbox failures.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS
AB Condition-based maintenance is an effective way to reduce operation and maintenance cost of wind turbine. Highly complex and non-stationary operational conditions of wind turbine pose a challenge to conventional condition monitoring technique. Thus, a systematic multi-parameter health condition evaluation framework that considers the dynamic operational conditions is proposed. After characteristic parameter selection and Gaussian mixture model based multi-regime modeling, evidential reasoning is developed to evaluate the health condition of wind turbine. The proposed approach shows good health condition evaluation performance not only on the parameter level but also on the component and system level. Case studies indicate the effectiveness and potential applications of the proposed method for the wind turbine health condition evaluation. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

DT Article
DE Condition monitoring; Wind turbine; SCADA
AB Wind turbines are being increasingly deployed in remote onshore and offshore areas due to the richer wind resource there and the advantages of mitigating the land use and visual impact issues. However, site accessing difficulties and the shortage of proper transportation and installation vehicles/vessels are challenging the operation and maintenance of the giants erected at these remote sites. In addition to the continual pressure on lowering the cost of energy of wind, condition monitoring is being regarded as one of the best solutions for the maintenance issues and therefore is attracting significant interest today. Much effort has been made in developing wind turbine condition monitoring systems and inventing dedicated condition monitoring technologies. However, the high cost and the various capability limitations of available achievements have delayed their extensive use. A cost-effective and reliable wind turbine condition monitoring technique is still sought for today. The purpose of this paper is to develop such a technique through interpreting the SCADA data collected from wind turbines, which have already been collected but have long been ignored due to lack of appropriate data interpretation tools. The major contributions of this paper include: (1) develop an effective method for processing raw SCADA data; (2) propose an alternative condition monitoring technique based on investigating the correlations among relevant SCADA data; and (3) realise the quantitative assessment of the health condition of a turbine under varying operational conditions. Both laboratory and site verification tests have been conducted. It has been shown that the proposed technique not only has a potential powerful capability in detecting incipient wind turbine blade and drive train faults, but also exhibits an amazing ability in tracing their further deterioration.

AB Implementation of a condition monitoring system is a difficult decision due to many uncertain parameters. This is certainly the case for the wind turbine industry where factors like long logistical times and weather conditions have a major influence on the economic benefit. One of the parameters that is neglected in most of the available literature is the performance of the condition monitoring system itself. In this paper a new concept for modeling this performance based on the P-F curve of different failure modes is presented. The concept is illustrated on an extensive case study for a gearbox of a wind turbine. A stochastic simulation model is constructed in order to quantify the economic added value of implementing an imperfectly performing condition monitoring system into a gearbox. This case study proves that a condition monitoring system generates an economic benefit compared to the currently applied maintenance strategy. However, the magnitude of this benefit depends strongly on the performance of the condition monitoring system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A review of current progress in Condition Monitoring (CM) of wind turbine gearboxes and generators is presented, as an input to the design of a new continuous CM system with automated warnings based on a combination of vibrational and Acoustic Emission (AE) analysis. For wind turbines, existing reportage on vibrational monitoring is restricted to a few case histories whilst data on AE is even scarcer. In contrast, this paper presents combined vibration and AE monitoring performed over a continuous period of 5 days on a wind turbine. The vibrational and AE signatures for a healthy wind turbine gearbox and generator were obtained as a function of wind speed and turbine power, for the full normal range of these operational variables. i.e. 5-25 m/s and 0-300 kW respectively. The signatures have been determined as a vital pre-requisite for the identification of abnormal signatures attributable to shaft and gearbox defects. Worst-case standard deviations have been calculated for the sensor data. These standard deviations determine the minimum defect signal that could be detected within the defined time interval without false alarms in an automated warning system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB As the demand for wind energy continues to grow at exponential rates, reducing operation and maintenance costs and increasing reliability is now a top priority. Aside from developing more advanced wind turbines designs to improve the availability, an effective way to achieve this improvement is to apply reliable and cost-effective condition monitoring techniques. After highlighting on condition monitoring, diagnosis and maintenance theories, this paper outlines the relationship between these theories and related technical concepts. It also takes a look on new trends and future challenges in the wind turbine condition monitoring industry.

AB Fault recognition for Wind Turbine Generator's (WTG) mechanical system is a fundamental task of Condition Monitoring System and depends on the time-frequency feature of the monitored signals. A recognition method by matching the Hilbert-Huang Spectrum (HHS) of the vibration signal is proposed. Fault recognition is formulated as an aligning process that shifts the vibration's HHS to match the pre-defined fault pattern using ICP. Given that the duration and initial frequency feature of the HHS may lead to different aligning results, iteration parameters with multiple time-scales and positions are set. In simulations, a mechanical fault is identified and the effectiveness is compared. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Planetary gearboxes are required in many applications but have a high failure rate especially in wind turbines where rapid growth in turbine size is placing larger demands on the gearboxes. Current condition monitoring techniques are less effective at detecting faults in planetary gearboxes due to the complexity of the internal rotating components. A small scale planetary gearbox was, therefore, needed for testing on a gearbox test rig to develop a more effective method of condition monitoring. The detailed computer design and manufacture of the planetary gearbox for this purpose is detailed in this paper.

AB Fault diagnosis of localized defects in motor bearings using electrical current signal analysis has previously been reported in the literature. An extension of this concept is the detection of faults in mechanical components influencing the operation of an induction motor, such as a gearbox connected to the motor, using electrical current.
   This paper presents a dynamic model-based approach to quantify the severity of upstream mechanical equipment faults on electrical current-based fault diagnosis metrics, using a wind turbine system as an example. A lumped parameter-based dynamic model was used to develop the system of equations representing the rotational motion of the drive train components in a wind turbine. This mechanical model was coupled with a dynamic model for a doubly-fed induction generator to simulate the electrical current output under faulty operating conditions. The changes in the fault diagnosis metric under different levels of severity of the fault were investigated. The influence of faults in multiple gears of the gearbox on the electrical current signals was also investigated. This method can be advantageous compared with existing approaches involving vibration analysis because it is a non-invasive and remote monitoring approach, and may not even require additional instrumentation. This approach is particularly useful for wind turbine operators as well as designers seeking to implement a low-cost condition monitoring solution for gear fault detection in a wind turbine.

AB Wind turbines are fundamental components of power conversion. With the increasing number of wind turbines worldwide, the exposure to harsh environmental conditions and the use of remote areas like offshore, arctic or desert regions, it has become important to predict abnormal machine behaviour as early as possible. Therefore, automated fault detection is necessary. Fault detection will prevent extensive damage in case of a fault and create time to react to faults, for example, to prepare inspections and/or to purchase spare parts. To reduce the downtime of wind turbines, fault detection systems are already widely used but more research and development need to be done. The diagnostic approach of those systems is to use pre-set fixed alert thresholds but has several drawbacks and therefore makes fault isolation difficult. To overcome the drawbacks of the common systems, this paper introduces model based condition monitoring using residual generation to wind turbine drive trains. Residuals describe the difference between the measurements and the model output. The model output represents the non-faulty system behaviour. If the measurement deviates from the model output a fault is indicated. Residual generation is a known approach for other systems. A mathematical model of a system, such as a wind turbine drive train, depends on the actual and past machine operation as well as on the ambient conditions. By knowing these conditions and being able to describe them in an analytic way, a model can be derived using the well-known state-space representation.

AB As the demand for wind energy continues to grow at exponential rates, reducing operation and maintenance costs and increasing reliability is now a top priority. Aside from developing more advanced wind turbines designs to improve the availability, an effective way to achieve this improvement is to apply reliable and cost-effective condition monitoring techniques. This paper is a general review and classification of methods and techniques for wind turbine condition monitoring. After highlighting on condition monitoring, diagnosis and maintenance theories, it outlines the relationship between these theories and related technical concepts.

AB Over the past decade the wind energy sector has grown worldwide from an installed capacity of 31.1 GW in 2002 to 273 GW in 2012. South Africa is forecasted to be one of the largest future developing markets for wind generation, particularly due to the need to introduce clean renewable energy into the generation capacity that currently consists predominantly of fossil fuel plants.
   This paper presents results of on-going research that focuses specifically on the condition monitoring of the slip ring component found in a doubly-fed induction generator, the most widely used generator topology throughout the wind energy sector. The slip ring component is maintenance intensive and that results in frequent unplanned outages and serious plant failures. Online condition monitoring of the slip ring component, especially in quantifying and trending ageing effects, has the potential to result in improved maintenance strategies and the prevention of failures.
   The approach investigated in this research involves the use of parameter estimation techniques to determine condition-related model parameters using C-code and S-function models implemented in Matlab and compiled as a Simulink library. The study aims to determine to what extent the parameters of the various subsystems can be estimated accurately enough from measurements of the terminal voltage and current waveforms to facilitate an online condition monitoring strategy. This paper presents results for one aspect of this study, namely condition monitoring of the slip ring component. Case studies are done on various theoretical-and laboratory data sets and the results of which are then compared and examined.

AB To increase wind energy production rate, there is a pressing need to improve the wind turbine availability and reduce the operational and maintenance costs. The safety and reliability of a functioning wind turbine depend largely on the protective properties of the lubrication oil for its drive train subassemblies such as gearbox and means for lubrication oil condition monitoring and degradation detection. The purpose of lubrication oil condition monitoring and degradation detection is to determine whether the oil has deteriorated to such a degree that it no longer fulfills its function. In this paper, particle contamination of lubrication oil and the remaining useful life (RUL) of the particle contaminated lubrication oil are investigated. Physical models are developed to quantify the relationship between particle contamination level and the outputs of commercially available online oil dielectric and viscosity sensors. The effectiveness of the developed models is then validated using laboratory experiments. In particular, the remaining useful life prediction of degraded lubrication oil with viscosity and dielectric constant data using particle filtering is presented. A simulation case study is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed technique.

AB Mechanical failures of wind turbines represent a significant cost in both repairs and downtime. Detecting incipient faults of wind turbine components permits maintenance to be scheduled and failed parts to be repaired or replaced before causing failures of other components or catastrophic failure of the system. This paper proposes a Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT)-based algorithm to effectively extract fault signatures in generator current signals for wind turbine fault diagnosis by using the HHT's capability of accurately representing the instantaneous amplitude and frequency of nonlinear and nonstationary signals. A phase-lock-loop (PLL) method is integrated to estimate wind turbine rotating speed, which is then used to facilitate the fault detection. The proposed method is validated by a real direct-drive wind turbine with different types of faults. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective to detect various faults in wind turbine systems as well as to reveal the severities of the faults.

AB Development of large scale offshore wind and marine current turbine farms implies to minimize and predict maintenance operations. In direct-or indirect-drive, fixed-or variable-speed turbine generators, advanced signal processing tools are required to detect and diagnose the generator faults from vibration, acoustic, or generator current signals. The induction generator is traditionally used for wind turbines power generation. Even if induction machines are highly reliable, they are subjected to many types of faults. The aim then, is to detect them at an early stage in order to prevent breakdowns and consequently ensure the continuity of power production. In this context, this paper deals with wind turbines condition monitoring using a fault detection technique based on the generator stator current. The detection algorithm uses a recursive maximum likelihood estimator to track the time-varying fault characteristic frequency and the related energy. Furthermore, a decision-making scheme and a related criterion are proposed.
   The feasibility of the proposed approach has been demonstrated using simulation data issued from coupled magnetic circuits induction generator model driven by a wind turbine for both electrical asymmetry and mechanical imbalance.

AB Distributed generation (DG) systems comprising of renewable energy generation technologies will play a significantly increasing role for future power systems. One of the key concerns for deployment of DG systems is specifically related to their availability and reliability, particularly when operating in a harsh environment. Condition monitoring (CM) can meet the requirement but has been challenged by huge amount of data to be processed especially in real time in order to reveal healthy conditions of the system. In this paper, an optimal sensor selection method based on principal component analysis (PCA) is proposed for condition monitoring of a DG system oriented to wind turbines. The proposed method is examined with both simulation data from PSCAD/EMTDC and SCADA data of an operational wind farm in the time, frequency, and time-frequency domains. The results have shown that the proposed technique could reduce the number of sensors whilst still maintaining sufficient information to assess the system's conditions.

AB A microgrid is a cluster of power generation, consumption and storage systems capable of operating either independently or as part of a macrogrid. The mechanical condition of the power production units, such as the small wind turbines, is considered of crucial importance especially in the case of islanded operation. In this paper, the fault assessment is achieved efficiently and consistently via electric signature analysis (ESA). In ESA the fault related frequency components are manifested as sidebands of the existing current and voltage time harmonics. The energy content between the fundamental, 5th and 7th harmonics (referred as residual value - RV) is measured and sent to the central microgrid controller. The controller compares RV to three predefined limits where inspection, maintenance and shut down of the turbine are the corresponding actions. The method is tested based on a finite element model where dynamic eccentricity and bearing outer race defect are simulated under varying fault severity and electric loading conditions.

AB The spectral content of the low frequency vibrations in the band from 0 to 10 Hz measured in full scale wind turbines has been statistically analyzed as a function of the whole range of steady operating conditions. Attention has been given to the amplitudes of the vibration peaks and their dependency on rotating speed and power output. Two different wind turbine models of 800 and 2000 kW have been compared. For each model, a sample of units located in the same wind farm and operating during a representative period of time have been considered. A condition monitoring system installed in each wind turbine has been used to register the axial acceleration on the gearbox casing between the intermediate and the high speed shafts. The average frequency spectrum has permitted to identify the vibration signature and the position of the first tower natural frequency in both models. The evolution of the vibration amplitudes at the rotor rotating frequency and its multiples has shown that the tower response is amplified by resonance conditions in one of the models. So, it is concluded that a continuous measurement and control of low frequency vibrations is required to protect the turbines against harmful vibrations of this nature.

AB Offshore wind is a promising energy resource to face the climate change and to reduce the gas emissions. Over the last decade, this sector has experienced a very rapid growth, wind turbines have become much powerful and wind parks became bigger. However, the costs of operations and maintenance (O&M) still represent an important part of the cost of energy (about 30 %). Structural health monitoring (SHM) can play a major role to reduce these costs, by detecting coming failures before they occur and predicting the failure time.
   On a wind turbine (WT), hundreds of sensors can be found at different location and these sensors measure, for example, temperatures, output power, rotational speed, pitch and yaw angles, etc. Their primary functions are performance optimization and load control, but they are also used for condition monitoring. Unfortunately, a high number of sensors lead to more complexity and more sensor faults. As a result, relationships, correlations and redundancies are not used enough, even sometimes not used at all, in WT SHM. Moreover, through a high number of sensors, a wind turbine may be subjected to more and more frequent short stops that are not always necessary (false alarms).
   The main goal of this research is to optimize the sensor network and to improve its use for SHM. In this framework, several steps have to be considered. First, a theoretical analysis needs to be conducted to find what the minimum information is needed to understand a WT behavior. The WT behavior varies with respect to the environmental and operational conditions. Indeed, loads, rotation speed, power output, internal temperatures, etc. depend on these conditions. Assessing the health of a WT needs then to be performed in accordance to the working state of the WT.
   In the present research, the WT working states are described and classified into six main categories ('stopped', 'starting', 'running', 'transition around rated power', 'shutdown' and 'idling'). The possible previous and following states of each state have been determined, as well as the changes expected in the main signals. It is proven that a WT working state can be determined with only six sensors.
   This analysis will be used to build a reasoning system that can estimate the current working state and detect if there is a failure among six sensors used for working state detection. This system uses (physical) relationships between sensors, redundancies in the sensor network (at a WT level and at a wind farm level), knowledge of the previous state, expected signals from the current state, etc.

AB The National Renewable Energy Laboratory presented an investigation of various wind turbine drivetrain condition monitoring (CM) techniques at the 7th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring held in 2009. The study contained in this report is a continuation of the 2009 paper and focuses on results obtained by various CM techniques from a damaged Gearbox Reliability Collaborative test gearbox. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of each technique. In order to provide the audience a relatively complete picture, a brief discussion of CM system implementation is provided first. The dynamometer test setup, along with some failure information on the damaged gearbox obtained during its disassembly, is presented next, followed by the CM results obtained during the retest of the damaged gearbox. For comparison and discussion purposes, earlier results obtained from a test gearbox under healthy condition will also be included. Finally, the paper will conclude with some observations obtained during the tests.

AB This paper presents the research activities performed on a Small Wind Turbine (SWT) test stand. A commercially available turbine was modified towards incorporation of sensors for condition monitoring to measure angular shaft position, applied torque, rotational speed and vibration acceleration. Wind data are also acquired through an anemometer. A dedicated interface was initially developed to allow automatic and remote control of the Data Acquisition System. After each session, all acquired signals are stored in a database from where can be accessed for further processing. Once the reference response of the system is characterized, typical faults or dangerous operating conditions are simulated to obtain more information on the effects of these events on the response.. In particular, order tracking is used to identify anomalous vibration level at different RPMs.

AB Vibration signal is one kind of important variables for wind turbine in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) System. With modeling and analysis of vibration signals, incipient failure of key components such as tower, drive train and rotor could be detected. In this paper, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to model the tower vibration providing a good understanding of the tower vibration dynamic characteristics and the main factors influencing these. The merits and physical interpretation of PCA are also discussed and analyzed. With SCADA of one wind turbine during April to June in 2006, PCA model for tower vibration in normal working condition was established and validated. This method monitoring the operation of the wind generator by calculating the monitoring statistic Hotelling T-2 (T-2 for short) and SPE. If T-2 and SPE statistics over confidence limit, the decision system is abnormal. We can calculate contribution rate of each variable on the main component, then get the cause of the fault. Wind generator fault data set simulation verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Key focus of this paper is the investigation of condition monitoring and fault-tolerant control in the modular multi-stage air-cored permanent magnet synchronous generator called 'C' core generator under different electrical connections. Condition monitoring and fault-tolerant control have been identified as a means of improving the reliability and availability of offshore or inaccessible renewable energy devices. As a result, two different ways of connecting modular generator stages are presented. Based on the above topologies two wind turbine models are designed in MATLAB (R)/Simulink (R) and fault-tolerance is investigated by implementing single electrical faults in one of the stages, such as single phase open circuit, diode short circuit, two phase short circuit and diode open circuit. It was found that the first topology offers fault-tolerance against the single phase open circuit fault while the second offers isolation between generator stages in all types of faults. Finally, the signal processing techniques of alpha - beta current locus, Power Spectral Density analysis and Continuous Wavelet Transformation have been implemented in order to extract detectable patterns of the electrical faults.

AB This paper presents the research activity performed on a Small Wind Turbine (SWT) test stand. Commercially available turbine was modified towards incorporation of the sensors system for condition monitoring. Installed sensors measure angular shaft position, torque applied from the wind loads, vibration accelerations and last but not least rotational speed. All gathered data are then transferred and processed in Test.Lab by means of automatic in house developed Visual Basic application which afterwards converts TDF files to text files and stores them in a desired directory. The numerical simulation is being run in parallel to installed sensors measurements and is as well controlled by the same Visual Basic application. By having actual measurements and numerical simulation results one will be able to compare those two outcomes. In particular, if the numerical model is tailored to the physical one, data comparison will allow identifying malfunctioning due to component damage or extreme working condition.

   assessment
AB Operational Modal Analysis (OMA), also known as output-only modal analysis, allows identifying modal parameters only by using the response measurements of the structures in operational conditions when the input forces cannot be measured. This information can then be used to improve numerical models in order to monitor the operating and structural conditions of the system. This is a critical aspect both for condition monitoring and maintenance of large wind turbines, particularly in the off-shore sector where operation and maintenance represent a high percentage of total costs. Although OMA is widely applied, the wind turbine case still remains an open issue. Numerical aeroelastic models could be used, once they have been validated, to introduce virtual damages to the structures in order to analyze the generated data. Results from such models can then be used as baseline to monitor the operating and structural condition of the machine.

AB The aim of the present paper is to evaluate structural health monitoring (SHIM) techniques based on modal analysis for crack detection in small wind turbine blades. A finite element (FE) model calibrated to measured modal parameters will be introduced to cracks with different sizes along one edge of the blade. Changes in modal parameters from the FE model are compared with data obtained from experimental tests. These comparisons will be used to validate the FE model and subsequently discuss the usability of SHIM techniques based on modal parameters for condition monitoring of wind turbine blades.

ID DAMAGE DETECTION
AB Real-time structural health monitoring is becoming increasingly tractable on commodity wireless sensor devices and platforms. Such algorithmic implementations must be realised in as efficient a manner as possible, in terms of memory, computation, radio communications and power efficiency. This work describes an efficient, real-time, structural change detection algorithm implemented on constrained, commodity wireless sensor nodes. The algorithm, based on the Hilbert Huang transform, initially characterises the structure and reliably signals subsequent change using a hierarchical monitoring and alert infrastructure. The system operates entirely autonomously, and algorithmic parameterisations, such as sensitivity and training period duration, can be dynamically and remotely adjusted across the air interface. The system has been evaluated on two different structures which were subject to structural change during the experiments; a Single-Degree-of-Freedom discrete dynamical system, and a 5kW wind turbine blade. The system demonstrated a highly reliable capacity to promptly detect and actuate response to structural change.

DT Article
DE Maintenance; Predictive model; Reliability
AB The feasibility of maintenance processes relies on the availability of spare parts. Spare part inventory planning is capital intensive. It is based on demand forecasting, which possesses a high potential in reducing inventories. Even if condition monitoring systems are installed in technical systems, condition monitoring information is barely used to predict the failure probability of units. Therefore, an enhanced forecast model, which integrates SCADA information, has been developed. This leads to more accurate spare part demand forecasts. The approach presented in the paper is based on data mining, the proportional hazards model (PHM) and a binomial distribution. It has been validated with maintenance data of wind energy systems.

AB Fault of gearbox is one of the significant causes which lead to high cost of wind farm, so early fault prediction of gearbox is meaningful for ensuring reliable running and reducing maintenance costs. With condition monitoring data, the relation between gearbox temperature and potential faults was researched and a new method for online fault prediction of wind turbine gearbox was presented. First, the temperature prediction model for normal behavior of gearbox was built up by non-linear regression analysis. Then, a detecting function which can indicate the deviation between actual running state and prediction state of gearbox was introduced. The condition of gearbox could be monitored by comparing the real-time value of detecting function with the chosen threshold. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrated that this method could predict the abnormality of gearbox in time, and it can be applied to monitor the running condition of gearbox.

DE Wind turbine; condition monitoring; fault diagnosis; offshore
AB Wind energy conversion is the fastest-growing source of new electric generation in the world. The unforeseen damages of a component in a wind turbine have significant impact on the wind turbines, especially offshore ones. There has been a trend towards adoption of various forms of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis to know the deteriorating condition for both mechanical and electrial components, well in advance of a breakdown. This paper review the most recent advances in these areas with a special focus on offshore wind turbines. Different type of faults on offshore wind turbines are reviewed, including gearbox and bearing failures, generators failures, rotor failures and electrical failures. And then two widely-used methods(vibration analysis and oil monitoring) for predictive condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in offshore wind turbines are reviewed.

DE Condition monitoring; Automated threshold setting; Probability
   distribution; False alarms
AB A suitable setting of threshold levels has been a dilemma for engineers in a number of science and industrial fields. It is a common problem in monitoring, where deviation from a correct state needs to be detected. As the number of monitored values in modern systems reaches thousands, threshold calculations became a significant yet frequently underestimated concern. Due to a prohibitive cost of manual threshold setting, many systems generate thousands of false alarms consequent upon running on default threshold levels. In the paper, the authors illustrate a methodology for automatic threshold calculations in a large monitoring system. The paper is mainly addressed to engineers and machine monitoring systems developers, therefore selected statistical topics were treated briefly with main focus on practical solutions. Two fundamental data types are considered; namely, vibration signal measures, which can be extended to any nonnegative data, and symmetrical process values. As it is shown, these data types have significantly different probability distributions. Since real data seldom fits the Gaussian model, an investigation of several distributions and their comparison is presented. The proposed approach is validated on four datasets including process values from a gas compressor and vibration signal measures from a wind turbine. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   analysis; Diagnosis
AB Due to the increase in worldwide energy demand, wind energy technology has been developed rapidly over the past years. With a fast growing of wind power installed capacity, an efficient monitoring system for wind energy conversion system (WEC) is required to ensure operational reliability, high availability of energy production and at the same time reduce operating and maintenance (O&M) costs. The state of the art methodologies for WEC condition monitoring are signal analysis, observer-based approach, neural networks, etc. In this paper, an effective and easy adaptable multivariate data-driven method for wind turbine monitoring and fault diagnosis is introduced, which consists of three parts: 1) off-line training process 2) on-line monitoring phase 3) on-line diagnosis phase. The performance of this method is validated for detection of sensor abnormalities that have occurred in real wind turbines.

AB High operations and maintenance costs for wind turbines reduce their overall cost effectiveness. One of the biggest drivers of maintenance cost is unscheduled maintenance due to unexpected failures. Continuous monitoring of wind turbine health using automated failure detection algorithms can improve turbine reliability and reduce maintenance costs by detecting failures before they reach a catastrophic stage and by eliminating unnecessary scheduled maintenance. A SCADA-based condition monitoring system uses data already collected at the wind turbine controller. It is a cost-effective way to monitor wind turbines for early warning of failures and performance issues. In this paper, we develop three tests on power curve, rotor speed curve and pitch angle curve of individual turbine. To monitor the turbine performance better in daily base, it is critical to recognize different patterns of turbine health condition by fusing all the test results. We apply particle swarm optimization algorithm to determine the fusion rules more objectively and optimally. This novel approach gains a qualitative understanding of turbine health condition to detect faults at an early stage, and also provides explanations on what has happened for detailed diagnostics.

AB In recent years Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system has been used to monitor the condition of wind turbine components. SCADA being an integral part of wind turbines comes at no extra cost and measures an array of signals. This paper proposes to use artificial neural networks (ANN) algorithm for analysis of SCADA data for condition monitoring of components.
   The first step to build an ANN model is to create the training data set. Here an automated process to decide the training data set has been presented. The approach reduces the number of samples in the training data set compared to the conventional method of hand picking the data set. Further the approach describes how the ANN model could be kept in tune with the changes in the operating conditions of the wind turbine by updating the ANN model. The fault prognosis obtained from the model can be used to optimize the maintenance scheduling activity.

AB Effective cooling is required in power generation, processing, and distribution to avoid failure that could occur during operations. As heat loads continue to increase, manufacturers of wind turbines are turning to improve the cooling system to remove high intensity heat loads from many active parts particularly in the generator part. Wind generators need an effective cooling system due to the large amount of heat that is released during power production. Many large wind turbines (more than 5MW rated power) particularly offshore wind turbines where the water is available, heat exchangers with water-air cooling system is used, in which the water is utilized to cool the hot air. This type of heat exchangers are desired, since they are more efficient and reliable than the air-air heat exchangers, which are used in small wind turbines. Because of the growing number of failures that occurred in wind turbine generators due to high generator's temperatures owing to power losses of generator, applying condition monitoring system on wind generators depending on heat transfer analysis through the heat exchangers of wind generators plays an effective function. This helps avoid failures, decrease the potential shutdowns during running, and maintain wind turbines to be protected. In this paper new methodology has been applied by considering the heat transfer and fluid mechanics analysis through a heat exchanger of wind generator, which uses water to air cooling system. Case study based on data collected from actual measurements demonstrates the adequacy of the proposed model.

AB The development and implementation of condition monitoring system become very important for wind industry with the increasing number of failures in wind turbine generators due to over temperature especially in offshore wind turbines where higher maintenance costs than onshore wind farms have to be paid due to their farthest locations. Monitoring the wind generators temperatures is significant and plays a remarkable role in an effective condition monitoring system. Moreover, they can be easily measured and recorded automatically by the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) which gives more clarification about their behavior trend. An unexpected increase in component temperature may indicate overload, poor lubrication, or possibly ineffective passive or active cooling. Many techniques are used to reliably predict generator's temperatures to avoid occurrence of failures in wind turbine generators. Multiple Linear Regression Model (MLRM) is a model that can be used to construct the normal operating model for the wind turbine generator temperature and then at each time step the model is used to predict the generator temperature by measuring the correlation between the observed values and the predicted values of criterion variables. Then standard errors of the estimate can be found. The standard error of the estimate indicates how close the actual observations fall to the predicted values on the regression line. In this paper, a new condition-monitoring method based on applying Multiple Linear Regression Model for a wind turbine generator is proposed. The technique is used to construct the normal behavior model of an electrical generator temperatures based on the historical generator temperatures data. Case study built on a data collected from actual measurements demonstrates the adequacy of the proposed model.

The growing number of wind turbine makes all kinds of condition monitoring must be achieved online. In this paper, the fault of gearbox in wind turbine is researched deeply, based on electromagnetic field theory, propose a method to measure gear box oil composition. It provides an online method to monitor the wind turbine gearbox oil. This paper analyzes the principle of the method, sets up the equivalent circuit model and makes a detailed mathematical derivation of argument, then according to the simulation in Matlab; we verify the feasibility of this method. This method can realize monitoring gearbox oil composition, the real-time status of mechanical wear can be get on line, then indirectly found that various types of early failure of the gearbox. Successfully getting such warning signals early, relative staff can be effectively guided in the equipment maintenance arrangements before serious wear and failure happen. This will reduce equipment damage, reduce the impact of downtime production, at the same time increase the average time between failures of equipment, then result in the productivity improvement.

AB The renewable energy sector is increasing in size and wind-farm technology has improved in leaps and bounds. However the concepts of Health and Usage Monitoring and remote condition monitoring seem not to have kept pace. Whilst the manufacturers offer such technology, the user or owner communities have perhaps not understood the need and have not embraced the technology which could increase maintenance efficiency and increase availability. Using an example of a failure in a gearbox after nearly 4 years of operation and which resulted in nearly 7 weeks loss of availability, the paper identifies research questions that could produce a more enlightened maintenance regime for wind-farms based on usage and remote condition monitoring.

AB During the past decades, great efforts have been undertaken to make wind power a competitive source for electrical energy. By the end of 2012, global installed wind capacity had risen to 264GW, almost a tenfold increase of the capacity in 2002. Nevertheless, the wind energy sector is still far too expensive to be profitable, especially the strong growing offshore branch. However, a significant part (about 25%) of the cost is related to operation and maintenance (O&M), in particular the failures of the main components (i.e. gearbox and drivetrain) resulting in long downtimes and hence high O&M costs. Various studies today discuss if condition monitoring systems, which allow the forecasting of failures at a very early stage, might be the cure to the problems related to the reliability of the gearbox. Rather than formulating yet another methodology to forecast upcoming failures, the aim of this paper is to identify the underlying cause of the reliability issues related to the gearbox.

AB Rapid increase in global energy requirements has resulted in considerable attention towards energy generation from the renewable energy sources. In order to meet renewable energy targets, harnessing energy from all available resources including those from urban environment is required. Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) are seen as a potential way of utilising urban energy sources. Most of the research on the wind turbines constitutes condition monitoring and performance optimisation of VAWTs under a constant velocity of air where the transient effects have not been accounted. The inconsistent behaviour of the wind may change the nature of the flow field around the VAWT which could decrease its life cycle. This study is an attempt to use Computational Fluid Dynamic's techniques to study and analyse the performance of a wind turbine under accelerating and decelerating air inlet velocity. The performance of a VAWT is monitored under an accelerated and decelerated gust of the value 1.09m/s(2) characterised by change in velocity from 4m/sec to 10m/sec. The instantaneous torque output varies significantly when a gust of air is applied to the turbine. Furthermore the torque outputs during accelerating and decelerating flows vary, highlighting the effect of transient phenomena. This abrupt change in the instantaneous torque output of the turbine may give rise to highly transient loads on the turbine's structure which may induce heavy stresses on the turbine leading to structural failure. It has been shown that CFD can be used as an effective tool to predict the performance outputs of a VAWT under varying flow conditions. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Real-time deflection monitoring of a composite wind turbine blade was accomplished using the shape estimation algorithm with modal approach and strain data from embedded fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. The finite element model of the composite wind turbine blade was created and the displacement-strain transformation (DST) matrix on the basis of the modal approach was obtained. The locations of the nine FBG strain sensors were optimized by minimizing the condition number of the displacement-strain transformation matrix. The deflection-monitoring test of the 11m span composite blade was conducted to verify the shape reconstruction algorithm and applicability of the FBG sensors in structural condition monitoring. The estimated shapes measured by embedded Bragg grating sensors are compared with the directly captured deflection shapes measured by stereo pattern recognition (SPR) cameras. The results confirm very close agreement showing the potentials of the proposed shape estimation technique using arrayed Bragg grating sensors.

DE ANFIS models; Condition monitoring; Wind turbine; SCADA data; Normal
   behavior models
AB This paper proposes a system for wind turbine condition monitoring using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Interference Systems (ANFIS). For this purpose: (1) ANFIS normal behavior models for common Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) data are developed in order to detect abnormal behavior of the captured signals and indicate component malfunctions or faults using the prediction error. 33 different standard SCADA signals are used and described, for which 45 normal behavior models are developed. The performance of these models is evaluated in terms of the prediction error standard deviations to show the applicability of ANFIS models for monitoring wind turbine SCADA signals. The computational time needed for model training is compared to Neural Network (NN) models showing the strength of ANFIS in training speed. (2) For automation of fault diagnosis Fuzzy Interference Systems (FIS) are used to analyze the prediction errors for fault patterns. The outputs are both the condition of the component and a possible root cause for the anomaly. The output is generated by the aid of rules that capture the existing expert knowledge linking observed prediction error patterns to specific faults. The work is based on continuously measured wind turbine SCADA data from 18 turbines of the 2 MW class covering a period of 30 months.
   The system proposed in this paper shows a novelty approach with regard to the usage of ANFIS models in this context and the application of the proposed procedure to a wide range of SCADA signals. The applicability of the set up ANFIS models for anomaly detection is proved by the achieved performance of the models. In combination with the FIS the prediction errors can provide information about the condition of the monitored components.
   In this paper the condition monitoring system is described. Part two will entirely focus on application examples and further efficiency evaluation of the system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

DE offshore wind turbines; jacket type substructure; system effects;
   stochastic model; reliability
AB Deeper waters and harsher environments are the main factors that make the electricity generated by offshore wind turbines (OWTs) expensive due to high costs of the substructure, operation & maintenance and installation. The key goal of development is to decrease the cost of energy (CoE). In consequence, a rational treatment of uncertainties is done in order to assess the reliability of critical details in OWTs. Limit state equations are formulated for fatigue critical details which are not influenced by wake effects generated in offshore wind farms. Furthermore, typical bi-linear S-N curves are considered for reliability verification according to international design standards of OWTs. System effects become important for each substructure with many potential fatigue hot spots. Therefore, in this paper a framework for system effects is presented. This information can be e.g. no detection of cracks in inspections or measurements from condition monitoring systems. Finally, an example is established to illustrate the practical application of this framework for jacket type wind turbine substructure considering system effects.

DE wind turbine; tower vibration; SCADA data; nonlinear state estimation

AB With appropriate vibration modeling and analysis the incipient failure of key components such as the tower, drive train and rotor of a large wind turbine can be detected. In this paper, the Nonlinear State Estimation Technique (NSET) has been applied to model turbine tower vibration to good effect, providing an understanding of the tower vibration dynamic characteristics and the main factors influencing these. The developed tower vibration model comprises two different parts: a sub-model used for below rated wind speed; and another for above rated wind speed. Supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) data from a single wind turbine collected from March to April 2006 is used in the modeling. Model validation has been subsequently undertaken and is presented. This research has demonstrated the effectiveness of the NSET approach to tower vibration; in particular its conceptual simplicity, clear physical interpretation and high accuracy. The developed and validated tower vibration model was then used to successfully detect blade angle asymmetry that is a common fault that should be remedied promptly to improve turbine performance and limit fatigue damage. The work also shows that condition monitoring is improved significantly if the information from the vibration signals is complemented by analysis of other relevant SCADA data such as power performance, wind speed, and rotor loads.

AB This paper proposed a novel wind turbine fault diagnosis method based on the local mean decomposition (LMD) technology. Wind energy is a renewable power source that produces no atmospheric pollution. The condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in wind turbine system are important in avoiding serious damage. Vibration analysis is a normal and useful technology in wind turbine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. However, the relatively slow speed of the wind turbine components set a limitation in early fault diagnosis using vibration monitoring method. The traditional time-frequency analysis techniques have some drawbacks which make them not suitable for the nonlinear, non-Gaussian signal analysis. LMD is a new iterative approach to demodulate amplitude and frequency modulated signals, which is suitable for obtaining instantaneous frequencies in wind turbine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. The experiment analysis of the wind turbine vibration signal proves the validity and availability of the new method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FED INDUCTION GENERATOR
AB Previous research for detecting incipient wind turbine failures, using condition monitoring algorithms, concentrated on wind turbine Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) signals, such as power output, wind speed and bearing temperatures, using power-curve and temperature relationships. However, very little research effort has been made on wind turbine SCADA alarms. When wind turbines are operating in significantly sized wind farms, these alarm triggers are overwhelming for operators or maintainers alike because of large number occurring in a 10?min SCADA period. This paper considers these alarms originating in two large populations of modern onshore wind turbines over a period of 12?years. First, an analysis is made on where the alarms originate. Second, a methodology for prioritizing the alarms is adopted from an oil and gas industry standard to show the seriousness of the alarm data volume. Third, two methods of alarm analysis, time-sequence and probability-based, are proposed and demonstrated on the data from one of the wind turbine populations, considering pitch and converter systems with known faults. The results of this work show that alarm data require relatively little storage yet provide rich condition monitoring information. Both the time-sequence and probability-based analysis methods have the potential to rationalize and reduce alarm data, providing valuable fault detection, diagnosis and prognosis from the conditions under which the alarms are generated. These methods should be developed and integrated into an intelligent alarm handling system for wind farms, aimed at improving wind turbine reliability to reduce downtime, increase availability and leading to a well-organized maintenance schedule.

AB Renewable energy sources have a key role to play in the global energy mix as a means of reducing the impact of energy production on climate change. Wind energy is the most developed of all renewable energy technologies with more than 200 GW of globally installed capacity as of 2011. Analyses of wind farm maintenance costs show that up to 40% of the outlay is related to unexpected component failures that lead to costly unscheduled amendments. Wind farm operators are constantly looking for new technological developments in condition monitoring that can contribute to the minimisation of wind turbine maintenance expenditure. Early fault detection through condition monitoring can help prevent major breakdowns as well as significantly decrease associated costs. Moreover it enables the optimisation of maintenance schedules, reduces downtime, increases asset availability and enhances safety and operational reliability. Faults in the braking system are of particularly concern since they can result in catastrophic failure of the wind turbine. The present study investigates online condition monitoring based on voltages and currents for mechanical wind turbine brake system fault diagnosis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Operation and maintenance (OM) cost has contributed a major share in the cost of energy for wind power generation. Condition monitoring can help reduce the OM cost of wind turbine. Among the wind turbine components, the fault diagnosis of the hydraulic pitching system is investigated in this study. The hydraulic pitching system is critical for energy capture, load reduction, and aerodynamic braking. The fault detection of internal and external leakages in the hydraulic pitching system is studied in this paper. Based on the dynamic model of the hydraulic pitching system, an adaptive parameter estimation algorithm has been developed in order to identify the internal and external leakages under the time-varying load on the pitch axis. This scheme can detect and isolate individual faults in spite of their strong coupling in the hydraulic model. A scale-down setup has been developed as the hydraulic pitch emulator, with which the proposed method is verified through experiments. The pitching-axis load input is obtained from simulation of a 1.5-MW variable-speed-variable-pitch turbine model under turbulent wind profiles on the FAST (fatigue, aerodynamics, structural, and tower) software developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. With the experimental data, the leakage and leakage coefficients can be predicted via the proposed method with good performance.

DE Wind turbine performance assessment; Multi-regime modeling; Prognostics
   & health management
AB Prognostics & health management system is an integral component of any wind energy program to ensure high turbine availability and reliability. Traditional vibration-based condition monitoring practices have been proposed to be utilized with wind turbines as they have demonstrated varying degrees of success with other rotary machinery. However, high-frequency data such as vibration and acoustic emission signals, generally, are not collected and recorded due to limitations with data storage capacities. In addition, the highly dynamic operating conditions of a wind turbine pose a challenge to conventional frequency domain analysis tools. Thus, a systematic framework that utilizes multi-regime modeling approach is proposed to consider the dynamic working conditions of a wind turbine. Three methods were developed, and they were evaluated using SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) data only that have been collected from a large-scale on-shore wind turbine for 27 months. Empirical observations from the results of the three methods indicate the ability of the approach to trend and assess turbine degradation prior to known downtime occurrences.

ID SYSTEMS; FAULT; MODEL
AB This study investigates the condition monitoring of wind turbine wound rotor and doubly fed induction generators with rotor electrical asymmetries by analysis of stator current and total power spectra. The research is verified using experimental data measured on two different test rigs and numerical predictions obtained from a time-stepping electromagnetic model. A steady-state study of current and power spectra for healthy and faulty conditions is performed to identify fault-specific signal changes and consistent slip-dependent fault-indicators on both test rigs. To enable real-time fault frequency tracking, a set of concise analytical expressions, describing fault frequency variation with operating speed, were defined and validated by measurement. A variable speed study, representative of real wind turbine operations, of current and power frequency components for healthy and faulty conditions was then carried out on one test rig, which could simulate wind conditions. The current and power fault frequency tracking previously identified achieved reliable fault detection for two realistic wind turbine generator fault scenarios of differing severity. Conclusions are drawn on the relative merits of current and power signal analysis when used for wind turbine wound rotor induction machine fault detection and diagnosis.

AB Data mining algorithms and statistical methods are applied to analyze the jerk data obtained from monitoring the gearbox of a wind turbine. Two types of analyses are performed-failure component identification and monitoring vibration excitement. In failure component identification, the failed stages of the gearbox are identified in time-domain analysis and frequency-domain analysis. In the time domain, correlation coefficient and clustering analysis are applied. The fast Fourier transformation with time windows is utilized to analyze the frequency data. To monitor the vibration excitement of the gearbox in its high-speed stage, data mining algorithms and statistical quality control theory are combined to develop a monitoring model. The capability of the monitoring model to detect changes in the gearbox vibration excitement is validated by the collected data.

AB Fault detection in complex mechanical systems such as wind turbine gearboxes remains challenging, even with the recently significant advancement of sensing and signal processing technologies. As first-principle models of gearboxes capable of reflecting response details for health monitoring purpose are difficult to obtain, data-driven approaches are often adopted for fault detection, identification or classification. In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework that combines information from multiple sensors and fundamental physics of the gearbox. Time domain vibration and acoustic emission signals are collected from a gearbox dynamics testbed, where both healthy and faulty gears with different fault conditions are tested. To deal with the nonstationary nature of the wind turbine operation, a harmonic wavelet based method is utilized to extract the time-frequency features in the signals. This new framework features the employment of the tachometer readings and gear meshing relationships to develop a speed profile masking technique. The time-frequency wavelet features are highlighted by applying the mask we construct. Those highlighted features from multiple accelerometers and microphones are then fused together through a statistical weighting approach based on principal component analysis. Using the highlighted and fused features, we demonstrate that different gear faults can be effectively detected and identified. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4004438]

AB The concept of reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) is applied to the two wind-turbine models Vestas V44-600 kW and V90-2MW. The executing RCM workgroup includes an owner and operator of the analyzed wind turbines, a maintenance service provider, a provider of condition-monitoring services, and wind-turbine component supplier as well as researchers at academia. Combining the results of failure statistics and assessment of expert judgement, the analysis is focused on the most critical subsystems with respect to failure frequencies and consequences: the gearbox, the generator, the electrical system, and the hydraulic system. This study provides the most relevant functional failures, reveals their causes and underlying mechanisms, and identifies remedial measures to prevent either the failure itself or critical secondary damage. This study forms the basis for the development of quantitative models for maintenance strategy selection and optimization, but may also provide a feedback of field experience for further improvement of wind-turbine design.

   technique (NSET); residuals analysis; trend analysis; wind turbine
AB Condition monitoring can greatly reduce the maintenance cost for a wind turbine. In this paper, a new condition-monitoring method based on the nonlinear state estimate technique for a wind turbine generator is proposed. The technique is used to construct the normal behavior model of the electrical generator temperature. A new and improved memory matrix construction method is adopted to achieve better coverage of the generator's normal operational space. Generator incipient failure is indicated when the residuals between model estimates and the measured generator temperature become significant. Moving window averaging is used to detect statistically significant changes of the residual mean value and standard deviation in an effective manner; when these parameters exceed predefined thresholds, an incipient failure is flagged. Examples based on data from the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system at a wind farm located at Zhangjiakou in northern China have been used to validate the approach and examine its sensitivity to key factors that influence the performance of the approach. It is demonstrated that the technique can identify dangerous generator over temperature before damage has occurred that results in complete shutdown of the turbine.

AB Condition Monitoring (CM) can greatly reduce the maintenance cost for a wind turbine. In this paper, history data of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is analyzed to detect the incipient failure of wind turbine generator bearing. A new condition monitoring method based on the Nonlinear State Estimate Technique (NSET) is proposed. NSET is used to construct the normal behavior model of the generator bearing temperature. Detail of NSET is introduced. When the generator bearing has an incipient failure, the residuals between NSET model estimates and the measured generator bearing temperature will become significant. When the residual exceeds the predefined thresholds, an incipient failure is flagged. Analysis of a manual drift added on the historical SCADA data for a wind turbine generator bearing demonstrates the effectiveness of this new condition monitoring method.

AB The objective of this paper is to present the methodology for the application of Reliability Centered Maintenance to wind turbines. The reliability and maintenance of wind turbines is a growing area of interest. The inherent variation in the loading experienced by wind turbines presents unique problems that differ from current practice within the power generation sector. The core of these issues center on the inherent variability of the wind and the resulting loads transferred to the equipment. Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) is a useful tool that provides the means to overcome some of these difficulties. RCM is implemented through either Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) or Time-Directed Maintenance (TDM). CBM is implemented through the use of condition monitoring based on defined condition indicators established through field experience, or laboratory testing. TDM is implemented through the use of reliability failure analysis to characterize a time directed maintenance interval. This failure analysis is performed on either laboratory test specimens, or failed field components. This paper presents the methodology for applying CBM or TDM to a wind turbine as well as suggestions for scaled laboratory testing.

AB This paper presents the latest research results of a project that focuses on normal behavior models for condition monitoring of wind turbines and their components, via ordinary Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) data. In this machine learning approach Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Interference System (ANFIS) models are employed to learn the normal behavior in a training phase, where the component condition can be considered healthy. In the application phase the trained models are applied to predict the target signals, e.g. temperatures, pressures, currents, power output, etc.
   The behavior of the prediction error is used as an indicator for normal and abnormal behavior, with respect to the learned behavior. The advantage of this approach is that the prediction error is widely decoupled from the typical fluctuations of the SCADA data caused by the different turbine operational modes.
   To classify the component condition Fuzzy Interference System, (FIS) structures are used. Based on rules that are established with the prediction error behavior during faults previously experienced and generic rules, the FIS outputs the component condition (green, yellow and red). Furthermore a first diagnosis of the root cause is given. In case of fault patterns earlier unseen the generic rules allow general statements about the signal behavior which highlight the anomaly.
   Within the current research project this method is applied to 18 onshore turbines of the 2 MW class operating since April 2009. First results show that the proposed method is well suited to closely monitor a large variety of signals, identify anomalies and correctly classify the component condition. The accuracy of the normal behavior models developed is high and small signal behavior changes become recognizable. The result of the automatic analysis is given in graphical and text format. Within the paper examples of real faults are provided, showing the capabilities of the method proposed. The method can be applied both to existing and new built turbines without the need of any additional hardware installation or manufacturers input.

AB This paper summarizes the application of "synchronous sampling" technique in the digital domain to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in detection of wind turbine gear and bearing damage signatures. In this technique, only a once-per-revolution Key Phaser or a low-count Encoder signal is required. High-count synchronous sampling is achieved by re-sampling in the digital domain. Implementation and demonstration of the aforementioned techniques are illustrated in two current wind turbine field operation examples. The improvement in the accuracy and precision of damage feature extractions is demonstrated.

AB Due to the harsh environment, the maintenance of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) is very difficult and the failure rate is very high. Improving the condition monitoring technologies will be beneficial to promote the performance of OWTs. Motivated by the application advantages of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in environment monitoring, a wireless network based condition health monitoring system for OWTs is proposed, which is composed of different types of wireless sensor nodes. Sensor nodes are deployed on the key components of OWTs based on the fault feature analysis on the different components. In order to guarantee the reliabilities of information collection and communication of the sensor nodes, the principles of the deployment and communication of the sensor nodes are presented and the cluster-based distributed wireless sensor network topology is adopted to increase the efficiency of the system. An example is given to illustrate the proposed method of the condition health monitoring for OWTs.

AB By analyzing the rotor structural dynamic response of a wind turbine, this research aims to improve decision making in operation and maintenance. To illustrate the potential of this measurement technique, a horizontal axis wind turbine test-bed is used to experimentally simulate the rotor structural dynamic response to uniform flow as well as horizontal and vertical shear flow across the rotor plane. The structural dynamic characteristics of the wind turbine rotor are described in the context of modal analysis where each mode of vibration occurs at a particular frequency with a particular modal deflection shape. These deflection shapes facilitate the effectiveness with which a given aerodynamic load couples into the rotor to produce mechanical power in addition to vibrations of the rotor. Operational modal analysis is used to explore the effects of changes in the wind state on the sensitivity of condition monitoring data to two types of damages in the turbine rotor, ice accretion and blade root cracking. Additionally, the degree to which various damage mechanisms can be identified in the presence of yaw and pitch set points is analyzed It is shown that certain frequencies in the measured response using the flap, edgewise, and span directions of the wind turbine are sensitive to a change in condition of the rotor for use in detecting that type of damage. By analyzing the changes in the modal response amplitudes, the type of damage present in the rotor system can also be classified.

AB High operations and maintenance costs for wind turbines reduce their overall cost effectiveness. One of the biggest drivers of maintenance cost is unscheduled maintenance due to unexpected failures. Continuous monitoring of wind turbine health using automated failure detection algorithms can improve turbine reliability and reduce maintenance costs by detecting failures before they reach a catastrophic stage and by eliminating unnecessary scheduled maintenance. A SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System) -data based condition monitoring system uses data already collected at the wind turbine controller. It is a cost-effective way to monitor wind turbines for early warning of failures and performance issues. In this paper, we describe our exploration of existing wind turbine SCADA data for development of fault detection and diagnostic techniques for wind turbines. We used a number of measurements to develop anomaly detection algorithms and investigated classification techniques using clustering algorithms and principal components analysis for capturing fault signatures. Anomalous signatures due to a reported gearbox failure are identified from a set of original measurements including rotor speeds and produced power.

AB This paper deals with the condition monitoring of a wind turbine gearbox under varying operating conditions, which cause nonstationarity. The gearbox vibration signals are decomposed into a set of monocomponent signals using the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method. The Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator (TKEO) in combination with an energy separation method is also presented as an alternative technique that seems to improve the time-frequency analysis of signals. In this study, the TKEO is applied to the signal components who's frequency bandwidth is related to the frequencies more influenced by damage. The Teager-Kaiser energy operator is a nonlinear operator that calculates the energy of monocomponent signals as the product of the square of the amplitude and the frequency of the signal. The instantaneous characteristics of these signals are then obtained by the application of the Discrete Energy Separation Algorithm (DESA-2). It will be shown that TKEO improves the estimation of instantaneous characteristics of the vibration data compared to other commonly used techniques, e. g. the Hilbert Transform.

AB Wind turbines are good examples of time-varying systems as their modal properties depend on their instantaneous configuration. To catch the variations of modal parameters in time-varying systems, classical identification methods have to be adapted to the non-stationary nature of the recorded signals. In this paper, it is proposed to study the dynamic behavior of an offshore five-megawatt wind turbine. First, a numerical model of the wind turbine is created to serve as reference. Then, the time-varying behavior of the system is evaluated by simulating a large number of possible configurations. To this purpose, time responses are generated from the numerical model submitted to different environmental conditions. The wind is considered as the main non-measured external excitation force on the structure and the responses are recorded at several locations to simulate a real measurement process. Special care is brought to the accessibility of the measurement locations and to the limited number of available sensors in practice. Using these simulated measurements, output-only identification methods are used to extract varying dynamic properties of the structure. The final objective of this work is to pave the way to online condition monitoring of wind turbines.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB The focus of the paper is on a design of a fatigue load estimator for predictive condition monitoring systems (CMS) of wind turbines. In order to avoid high-price measurement equipment required for direct load measuring, an indirect approach is suggested using only measurements from supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. Estimated loads can be further used for prediction of remaining operating lifetime of turbine components, detection of high stress level or fault detection. An augmented Kalman filter is chosen as the fatigue load estimator because its characteristics well suit for the real time application. This paper presents results of the estimation of the gearbox fatigue load, often called shaft torque, using simulated data of wind turbine. Noise sensitivity of the algorithm is investigated by assuming different levels of measurement noise. Shaft torque estimations are compared with simulated data and as the obtained results are promising, further work will be on a validation of the method using real wind turbine data.

AB Power generation has the goal of maximizing power output while minimizing operations and maintenance cost. The challenge for plant manager is to move closer to reliability limits while being confident the risks of any decision are understood. To attain their goals and meet this challenge they are coming to realize that they must have frequent, accurate assessment of equipment operating conditions, and a path to continued innovation-. At a typical plant, making this assessment involves the collection and effective analysis of reams of complex, interrelated production system data, including demand requirements, load, ambient temperature, as well as the dependent equipment data.
   Wind turbine health and performance data is available from periodic and real-time systems. To obtain the timeliest understanding of equipment health for all the key resources in a large plant or fleet, engineers increasingly turn to real-time, model-based solutions. Real-time systems are capable of creating actionable intelligence from large amounts and diverse sources of current data. They can automatically detect problems and provide the basis for diagnosis and prioritization effectively for many problems, and they can make periodic inspection methods much more efficient. Technology exists to facilitate prediction of when assets will fail, allowing engineers to target maintenance costs more effectively. But, it is critical to select the best predictive analytics for your plant. How do you make that choice correctly?
   Real-time condition monitoring and analysis tools need to be matched to engineering process capability. Tools are employed at the plant in lean, hectic environments; others are deployed from central monitoring centers charged with concentrating scarce resources to efficiently support plants. Applications must be flexible and simple to implement and use.
   Choices made in selection of new tools can be very important to future success of plant operations. So, these choices require solid understanding of the problems to be solved and the advantages and trade-offs of potential solutions. This choice of the best Predictive Analytic solution will be discussed in terms of key technology elements and key engineering elements.

AB Condition Monitoring of bearings used in Wind Turbines (WT) is an important issue and due to wide range of the operating conditions variations should be monitored online. Due to mentioned non-stationary load/speed conditions, signal processing and decision making for bearings diagnostics is still challenging issue. As a data source a professional monitoring system is used. Two kind of information have been acquired: RMS of vibration acceleration signal and generator power that is related to the operating conditions. The received data cover the period of several months, when the bearing has changed its condition significantly. Due to considerable variability of the mentioned data, an embedded decision making regarding the condition of bearings is difficult. The novel method proposed in the paper is based on statistical feature processing instead of just simple comparison of the value of the feature with threshold that is used in the system. Statistical data processing is done in two dimensional feature-load space in several sub-ranges of operating conditions. It has been found that for different load ranges behavior of data and effectiveness of bad-good data separation ability is different. Decomposition of data in several load sub-ranges has provided better recognition efficiency than for all data taken together.

AB Gearbox faults constitute a significant portion of all faults and downtime in wind turbines (WTs). Current-based gearbox fault diagnosis has significant advantages over traditional vibration-based techniques in terms of cost, implementation, and reliability. This paper derives a mathematical model for a WT drive train consisting of a two-stage gearbox and a permanent magnet (PM) generator, from which the characteristic frequencies of gear tooth breaks in generator stator current frequency spectra are clearly identified. A adaptive signal resampling algorithm is proposed to convert the variable fault characteristic frequencies to constant values for WTs running at variable speeds. A fault detector is proposed for diagnosis of gear tooth breaks using statistical analysis on the fault signatures extracted from the stator current spectra. Experimental results on a real gearbox are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed model and method for diagnosis of gear tooth breaks.

AB Wind turbines are nowadays one of the most promising energy sources. Every year, the amount of energy produced from the wind grows steadily. Investors demand turbine manufacturers to produce bigger, more efficient and robust units. These requirements resulted in fast development of condition-monitoring methods. However, significant sizes and varying operational conditions can make diagnostics of the wind turbines very challenging.
   The paper shows the case study of a wind turbine that had suffered a serious rolling element bearing (REB) fault. The authors compare several methods for early detection of symptoms of the failure. The paper compares standard methods based on spectral analysis and a number of novel methods based on narrowband envelope analysis, kurtosis and cyclostationarity approach.
   The very important problem of proper configuration of the methods is addressed as well. It is well known that every method requires setting of several parameters. In the industrial practice, configuration should be as standard and simple as possible. The paper discusses configuration parameters of investigated methods and their sensitivity to configuration uncertainties.

AB The paper develops a simplified two-degree-of-freedom gear model that simulates vibration signals under operational conditions similar to those of wind turbine gearboxes. Nonlinear characteristics were included in the model in order to obtain more realistic results. The two types of faults examined in this study are common periodic gear tooth faults and intermittent gear tooth faults. The latter type of faults appears to be a novel idea in the condition monitoring field. Transient loads are also taken into consideration in this study since such loads are commonly observed in wind turbine systems, and make it even more difficult to detect damage. The analysis of the obtained signals is done using a relatively new method, the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) that works well for nonstationary and nonlinear signals.

AB New generations of offshore wind turbines are playing a leading role in the energy arena. One of the target challenges is to achieve reliable Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of the blades. Fault detection at the early stage is a vital issue for the structural and economical success of the large wind turbines. In this study, experimental measurements of Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) are used and identification of mode shapes and natural frequencies is accomplished via an LMS system. Novelty detection is introduced as a robust statistical method for low-level damage detection which has not yet been widely used in SHM of composite blades. Fault diagnosis of wind turbine blades is a challenge due to their composite material, dimensions, aerodynamic nature and environmental conditions. The novelty approach combined with vibration measurements introduces an online condition monitoring method. This paper presents the outcomes of a scheme for damage detection of carbon fibre material in which novelty detection approaches are applied to FRF measurements. The approach is demonstrated for a stiffened composite plate subject to incremental levels of impact damage.

AB Condition Monitoring of bearings used in Wind Turbines (WT) is an important issue. In general, bearings diagnostics is well-recognized field; however it is not the case for machines working under non-stationary load. An additional difficulty is that the Main Bearing (MB) discussed here, it is used to support low speed shaft, so dynamic response of MB is not clear as for a high-speed shaft. In the case of varying load/speed a vibration signal acquired from bearings is affected by operation and makes the diagnosis difficult. These difficulties come from the variation of diagnostic features caused mostly by load/speed variation, low energy of sought features and high noise levels. In the paper a novel diagnostic approach is proposed for main rotor bearings used in wind turbines. From a commercial diagnostic system two kind of information have been acquired: peak-to-peak vibration acceleration and generator power that is related to the operating conditions. The received data cover the period of several months, when the bearing has been replaced due to its failure and the new one has been installed. Due to serious variability of the mentioned data, a decision-making regarding the condition of bearings is pretty difficult. Application of classical statistical pattern recognition for data from the period A (bad condition) and the period B (after replacement, good condition) is not sufficient because the probability density functions of features overlap each other (pdf of peak-to-peak feature for bad and good conditions). Proposed approach is based on an idea proposed earlier for planetary gearboxes, i.e. to analyse data for bad/good conditions in two-dimensional space, feature - load. It is shown that the final data presentation is a good basis to the very successful classification of data (i.e. recognition of damaged and undamaged bearings).

AB Along with the rapid economic development, the large power-generating wind energy conversion systems are increasing both in number and in size. Because of the high construction cost, the consequence of any structural failure, especially offshore where replacing a damaged member such as blade which weights tones, is pretty expensive. Consequently particular actions are required to the protection of these structures. Among these many strategies, continuously monitoring of the condition of the system which provides a predication long before the actual failure should be one of the most efficient ways. In the paper, the main problems and their corresponding surveillance schemes of the system including tower, foundation, blade and turbine nacelle are discussed.

AB In this paper, a remote condition monitoring system is proposed, which fundamentally consists of real-time monitoring modules on the plant side, a remote support centre and the communications between them. The paper addresses some of the key issues related on the monitoring system, including i) the implementation and configuration of a VPN connection, ii) an effective database system to be able to handle huge amount of monitoring data, and iii) efficient data mining techniques to convert raw data into useful information for plant assessment. The preliminary results have demonstrated that the proposed system is practically feasible and can be deployed to monitor the emerging new energy generation systems.

AB Minimum Entropy Deconvolution (MED) has been recently introduced to the machine condition monitoring field to enhance fault detection in rolling element bearings and gears. MED proved to be an excellent aid to the extraction of these impulses and diagnosing their origin, i.e. the defective component of the bearing. In this paper, MED is revisited and re-introduced with further insights into its application to fault detection and diagnosis in rolling element bearings. The MED parameter selection as well as its combination with pre-whitening is discussed. Two main cases are presented to illustrate the benefits of the MED technique. The first one was taken from a fan bladed test rig. The second case was taken from a wind turbine with an inner race fault. The usage of the MED technique has shown a strong enhancement for both fault detection and diagnosis. The paper contributes to the knowledge of fault detection of rolling element bearings through providing an insight into the usage of MED in rolling element bearings diagnostic. This provides a guide for the user to select optimum parameters for the MED filter and illustrates these on new interesting cases both from a lab environment and an actual case.

ID EXTENSION NEURAL-NETWORK; PATTERN-RECOGNITION
AB Maintaining a wind turbine and ensuring secure is not easy because of long-term exposure to the environment and high installation locations. Wind turbines need fully functional condition-monitoring and fault diagnosis systems that prevent accidents and reduce maintenance costs. This paper presents a simulator design for fault diagnosis of wind power systems and further proposes some fault diagnosis technologies such as signal analysis, feature selecting, and diagnosis methods. First, this paper uses a wind power simulator to produce fault conditions and features from the monitoring sensors. Then an extension neural network type-1- (ENN-1-) based method is proposed to develop the core of the fault diagnosis system. The proposed system will benefit the development of real fault diagnosis systems with testing models that demonstrate satisfactory results.

AB The proportion of worldwide installed wind power in power systems increases over the years as a result of the steadily growing interest in renewable energy sources. Still, the advantages offered by the use of wind power are overshadowed by the high operational and maintenance costs, resulting in the low competitiveness of wind power in the energy market. In order to reduce the costs of corrective maintenance, the application of condition monitoring to gearboxes becomes highly important, since gearboxes are among the wind turbine components with the most frequent failure observations. While condition monitoring of gearboxes in general is common practice, with various methods having been developed over the last few decades, wind turbine gearbox condition monitoring faces a major challenge: the detection of faults under the time-varying load conditions prevailing in wind turbine systems. Classical time and frequency domain methods fail to detect faults under variable load conditions, due to the temporary effect that these faults have on vibration signals. This paper uses the statistical discipline of outlier analysis for the damage detection of gearbox tooth faults. A simplified two-degree-of-freedom gearbox model considering nonlinear backlash, time-periodic mesh stiffness and static transmission error, simulates the vibration signals to be analysed. Local stiffness reduction is used for the simulation of tooth faults and statistical processes determine the existence of intermittencies. The lowest level of fault detection, the threshold value, is considered and the Mahalanobis squared-distance is calculated for the novelty detection problem.

AB The structure of a wind turbine blade plays a vital role in the mechanical and structural operation of the turbine. As new generations of offshore wind turbines are trying to achieve a leading role in the energy market, key challenges such as a reliable Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of the blades is significant for the economic and structural efficiency of the wind energy. Fault diagnosis of wind turbine blades is a "grand challenge" due to their composite nature, weight and length. The damage detection procedure involves additional difficulties focused on aerodynamic loads, environmental conditions and gravitational loads. It will be shown that vibration dynamic response data combined with AANNs is a robust and powerful tool, offering on-line and real time damage prediction. In this study the features used for SHM are Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) acquired via experimental methods based on an LMS system by which identification of mode shapes and natural frequencies is accomplished. The methods used are statistical outlier analysis which allows a diagnosis of deviation from normality and an Auto-Associative Neural Network (AANN). Both of these techniques are trained by adopting the FRF data for normal and damage condition. The AANN is a method which has not yet been widely used in the condition monitoring of composite materials of blades.
   This paper is trying to introduce a new scheme for damage detection, localisation and severity assessment by adopting simple measurements such as FRFs and exploiting multilayer neural networks and outlier novelty detection.

AB Infrared-based oil condition sensors provide valuable information about the condition of gears and thus permit long-term planning of maintenance work. Currently available systems are mainly based on non-dispersive methods providing information about one single oil condition parameter only. In many cases they are even adapted to only one type of oil. Miniaturized infrared spectrometers offer the possibility to simultaneously acquire a wealth of relevant oil condition parameters and are also applicable to a broad range of oil types. In this paper we present a method for selecting an appropriate spectral apparatus based on a multivariate calibration. We also show and discuss limitations of the respective spectral apparatus in terms of spectral bandwidth, resolution, and SNR on the quality of spectral data analysis. In addition, the realization and measurement results of a miniaturized infrared spectrometer are shown based on a linear variable filter (LVF) for gear oil monitoring of offshore wind turbine gearboxes.

AB In this paper, we present a prognosis architecture that allows the computation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a failing process. A process subject to an incipient fault experiments slowly developing degradation. Sensor measurements and Condition Monitoring (CM) data extracted from the system allow to follow up the process drift. The prognosis architecture we propose makes use of a dynamical clustering algorithm to model the data in a feature space. This algorithm uses a sliding window scheme on which the model is iteratively updated. Metrics applied on the parameters of this model are used to compute a drift severity indicator, which is also an indicator of the health of the system. The architecture for prognosis is applied on a benchmark of wind turbine. The used benchmark has been constructed to serve as a realistic wind turbine model. It was used in the context of a global scale fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control competition. The benchmark also proposed a drifting fault scenario that we used to test our approach.

AB Wind energy's contribution to electricity supply is significantly increasing. As a result, reliability of the wind turbine becomes crucial. Gearbox is known as one of the most critical subassemblies of the wind turbine in which failures could lead to a long-term and high cost downtime. Recently, electrical signature analysis has been considered as an alternative for vibration monitoring in order to detect both electrical and mechanical faults in a cheap, easy to install and accessible way. This paper aims to monitor the planetary gearbox effect of a wind turbine on the wound rotor induction generator using electrical signature. For that, dynamic model of a single stage planetary gearbox have been implemented. The proposed model includes essential non-linearities such as time varying mesh stiffness, transmission error and damping force. Simulation results clearly show that electromagnetic torque and stator current of generator contain mesh and rotating related frequencies of the gears in its spectra.

AB A fiber grating sensor system for use in condition monitoring of wind turbine blades is constructed. A rotary optical joint was used to connect the fiber grating sensors to the non-rotating signal processing unit with moderate insertion loss. The Bragg wavelengths were interrogated by a spectrometer demodulator which consisted of a volume phase grating and a 512-pixel photo-detector array. Using the constructed sensor system, various strain/temperature measuring experiments have been performed. We applied fiber grating sensors at different locations on the wind turbine blade. Different types of strain, stroke, and temperature variations were applied to the sensors and the results were analyzed according to the sensor locations and the blade's rotary speed.

AB Wind energy is currently the fastest growing source of renewable energy used for electrical generation around world. Wind farms are adding a significant amount of electrical generation capacity. The increase in the number of wind farms has led to the need for more effective operation and maintenance procedures. Condition Monitoring System(CMS) can be used to aid plant owners in achieving these goals. Its aim is to provide operators with information regarding the health of their machines, which in turn, can help them improve operational efficiency. In this work, wind turbine fault detection system based on wind vs. power performance curve obtained from SCADA is studied. Considered fault detection scheme utilizes artificial neural network for training normal behavior of wind turbine system. Furthermore, In order to verify the effectiveness of the performance curve based fault detection scheme, SCADA data obtained from 850kW wind turbine system installed in Kunsan Korea are used and various simulation studies were carried out.

TI Wind Turbine Condition Assessment Through Power Curve Copula Modeling
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY

DT Article
DE Energy conversion; power generation reliability; wind power generation
ID RELIABILITY
AB Power curves constructed from wind speed and active power output measurements provide an established method of analyzing wind turbine performance. In this paper, it is proposed that operational data from wind turbines are used to estimate bivariate probability distribution functions representing the power curve of existing turbines so that deviations from expected behavior can be detected. Owing to the complex form of dependency between active power and wind speed, which no classical parameterized distribution can approximate, the application of empirical copulas is proposed; the statistical theory of copulas allows the distribution form of marginal distributions of wind speed and power to be expressed separately from information about the dependency between them. Copula analysis is discussed in terms of its likely usefulness in wind turbine condition monitoring, particularly in early recognition of incipient faults such as blade degradation, yaw, and pitch errors.

AB Purpose - Bearings in field applications with high dynamic loading, e.g. wind energy plants, suffer from sudden failure initiated by subsurface material transformation, known as white etching cracks in a typical scale of mu m, preferably around the maximum Hertzian stress zone. Despite many investigations in this field no precise knowledge about the root cause of those failures is available, due to the fact that failure under real service conditions of wind energy plants differs from what is known from test rig results in terms of contact loading, lubrication or dynamics. The purpose of this paper is to apply Barkhausen noise measurement to a full bearing test ring running under conditions of elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EH L) with high radial preload.
   Design/methodology/approach - Full bearing tests are carried out by use of DGBB (Deep Grove Ball Bearings) with 6206 specification, material set constant as 100Cr6, martensitic hardening, 10-12 percent maximum retained austenite and radial preload of 3500 MPa. Speed is set 9000 rpm, temperature is self setting at 80 degrees C by test conditions. For tests, synthetic hydrocarbon base oil (Poly-alpha-Olefine) with a 1 percent amount of molydenumdithiophosphate (organic chain given as 2-ethylhexyl) was used.
   Findings - Non-destructive fractal dimension analyses by use of Barkhausen noise measurements is of versatile value in terms of recording bearing manufacturing processes, but can also be part of non-destructive condition monitoring of bearings in field applications, where predictive reactive maintenance is crucial for availability of the plant.
   Research limitations/implications - Barkhausen noise signal recording may also be valuable for case studies related to microstructure changes of steel under operation conditions. Bearings are exposed in plenty of conditions to phenomena such as straying currents, subsequently straying magnetic fields. Hardly anything is known about how microstructure of bearing steel is susceptible to such conditions. This will be part of further studies.
   Originality/value - Results given in the paper show that sudden bearing failure, according to formation of subsurface material property changes might be driven by activities of dislocations. Since those activities start with sequences of stress field-induced formation of domains, later by formation of low-angle subgrains, and at least phase transformation, recording of the Barkhausen signal would lead to real predictive condition monitoring in applications where a highly dynamic loading of the contact, even with low nominal contact pressure leads to sudden failure induced by white etching.

AB Condition monitoring measurements can be obtained from wind turbine components and be utilized to evaluate and predict the health conditions of the components and the turbines, and for scheduling condition based maintenance (CBM) activities. In existing work, all the wind turbines are assumed to be of the same type, and the lead times of different components are assumed to be constant. This is not the case in many practical applications. In this paper, we develop a CBM approach for wind turbine systems considering different types of wind turbines in a wind farm, and different lead times for different components, which lead to more accurate modeling of CBM activities in actual wind farms. In the proposed CBM approach, we present a new CBM policy involving two design variables for each turbine type, a method for turbine failure probability evaluation considering different lead times, and a CBM cost evaluation method. Numerical examples demonstrate the proposed CBM approach.

AB With the fast growth in wind energy technologies, research into the condition monitoring system for wind turbines has drawn more attentions. Despite the advantages from the condition monitoring systems, there are also several challenges for the application of condition monitoring system for wind turbines. Accurate and adequate information of the wind turbine is needed for the condition monitoring system to carry out analysis, particularly with the growing size of wind farms. Another challenge is the huge amount of data needing to be collected, handled and processed. Minimising the number of sensors whilst still maintaining a sufficient number to assess the system's conditions is a critical concern for condition monitoring. This paper focuses on the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the optimization of sensor selection for wind turbine condition monitoring. The principle behind the proposed methodology is presented and the method is also validated using simulation data obtained from wind power generation model in PSCAD/EMTDC.

AB Motivation: Condition monitoring and diagnostic practices have become significantly important part of offshore wind farms in order to cut down operation and maintenance costs. The challenge is to enable Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) strategy to be implemented to provide maintenance decisions and services at the right time i.e. maintenance is performed when it is needed and not too early and in vain and not too late i.e. causing breakdown and downtime. CBM implementation is challenging due to the complexity and scalability of remote sensing, data acquisition, data manipulation, state detection, health and prognostic assessment and advisory generation.
   Objective: The paper describes the condition monitoring and prognostic challenge from both academic and industrial perspectives and presents their requirements in order to enable them to cope with multiple and complex fault and failure mode types and provide cost-effective monitoring and prognostic techniques.
   Method: The paper utilises needs gathering techniques (i.e. interviews, reports, etc.) and a developed requirements analysis framework in order to provide traceable and high quality research and development requirements.
   Result: The state of the art of Predictive Health Monitoring (PHM), industrial stakeholders' requirements for CBM strategy and requirement analysis framework for better traceability and high quality elicitation process.
   Implication: The requirement elicitation process is importantly required for current offshore wind farms due to advanced technological development, rapid scaling up of systems, and harsher installation sites in order to achieve a successful CBM strategy and higher level of cost effectiveness than exists today.

DE wind turbine condition monitoring; gearbox; Autoassociative Kernel

AB Condition Monitoring (CM) of wind turbines can greatly reduce the maintenance costs for wind farms, especially for offshore wind farms. A new condition monitoring method for a wind turbine gearbox using temperature trend analysis is proposed. Autoassociative Kernel Regression (AAKR) is used to construct the normal behavior model of the gearbox temperature. With a proper construction of the memory matrix, the AAKR model can cover the normal working space for the gearbox. When the gearbox has an incipient failure, the residuals between AAKR model estimates and the measurement temperature will become significant. A moving window statistical method is used to detect the changes of the residual mean value and standard deviation in a timely manner. When one of these parameters exceeds predefined thresholds, an incipient failure is flagged. In order to simulate the gearbox fault, manual temperature drift is added to the initial Supervisory Control and Data Acquisitions (SCADA) data. Analysis of simulated gearbox failures shows that the new condition monitoring method is effective.

AB Structural health monitoring (SHM) is a process of implementing a damage detection strategy for a mechanical system. Wind turbine machinery stands to benefit from SHM significantly as the ability to detect early stages of damage before significant malfunction or structural failure occurs would reduce costs of wind power projects by reducing maintenance costs. Vibration analysis of dynamic structural response is an approach to SHM that has been successfully applied to mechanical and civil systems and shows some promise for wind turbine application. Traditionally, a setback to turbine vibration-based SHM techniques has been the unavailability of turbine vibration response data. This study begins to address this issue by presenting vibration response for a commercial 2.3 MW turbine to a limited number of operating conditions. A database of acquired vibration response signals detailing turbine response to yaw motion, start-up, operation and shutdown has been assembled. A Daubechies sixth-order wavelet was used to perform an eight-level discrete wavelet decomposition such that general trends and patterns within the signals could be identified. With further development, the presented analysis of vibration response may be integrated into routines to reduce downtime and failure frequency of utility scale wind turbines.

AB The main driver behind developing advanced condition monitoring (CM) systems for the wind energy industry is the delivery of improved asset management regarding the operation and maintenance of the gearbox and other wind turbine components and systems. Current gearbox CM systems mainly detect faults by identifying ferrous materials, water, and air within oil by changes in certain properties such as electrical fields. In order to detect oil degradation and identify particles, more advanced devices are required to allow a better maintenance regime to be established. Current technologies available specifically for this purpose include Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and ferrography. There are also several technologies that have not yet been or have been recently applied to CM problems. After reviewing the current state of the art, it is recommended that a combination of sensors would be used that analyze different characteristics of the oil. The information individually would not be highly accurate but combined it is fully expected that greater accuracy can be obtained. The technologies that are suitable in terms of cost, size, accuracy, and development are online ferrography, selective fluorescence spectroscopy, scattering measurements, FTIR, photoacoustic spectroscopy, and solid state viscometers.

AB Renewable energy sources will come at the beginning of the future energy resources. In particular, wind power is among the most discussed sources in Turkey and all over the world. In this study, a model of the three-blade horizontal-axis wind turbine was designed. Analysis of fault, which may occur as a result of a possible blade deformation, was performed with the model. Comparison is provided between generator rotor speeds and torques for the states of healthy and damaged blades. Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) approach was adopted as the analysis method. The state of the healthy blade and the broken one were clearly identified by means of the CWT.

TI A novel baseline model-based technique for condition monitoring of wind
   turbine components
SO INSIGHT
LA English
DT Article
ID DIAGNOSIS
AB The operating conditions of wind turbine components have been monitored by fitting acoustic emission (AE) and vibration sensors inside wind turbines and analysing sensor measurements using appropriate signal processing techniques. However, there is still no systematic approach which can take the operating parameters of wind turbines into account when analysing the sensor measurements for condition monitoring purposes. The operating parameters of wind turbines, such as, for example, wind speed, wind direction and turbine power output etc, often have a significant effect on the measured AE and vibration signals. Therefore, there is a need to develop an effective technique which can systematically consider the effect of these wind turbine operating parameters on the features of measured AE and/or vibration signals. Consequently, any changes in the signal features which are literally produced by an abnormality of the turbine components and/or system can be correctly identified.
   Motivated by this objective, in the present study we propose a novel baseline model-based technique for condition monitoring of wind turbine components. The idea is to establish a baseline model for an operating wind turbine which represents the relationship between the wind speed, turbine power output, turbine operating parameters and the appropriate features of correspondingly measured vibration and/or AE signals. Given a specific working condition, the model output can be regarded as the baseline features of measured AE and/or vibration signals. Therefore, any significant deviation of practically measured AE and vibration signal features from the baseline can be explained to be due to some kind of abnormality inside the turbine components and/or system. Consequently, the information can be effectively used to achieve the objective of condition monitoring and even fault diagnosis.
   The application of the proposed method to the real AE, vibration and turbine operating parameter (wind speed and power output) data collected from an operating wind turbine is described in the paper. The results verify the effectiveness of the new approach and demonstrate its potential to address complicated offshore wind turbine condition monitoring problems.

TI Bivariate empirical mode decomposition and its contribution to wind
   turbine condition monitoring
SO JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION

ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS
AB Accessing difficulties and harsh environments require more advanced condition monitoring techniques to ensure the high availability of offshore wind turbines. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has been shown to be a promising technique for meeting this need. However, EMD was developed for one-dimensional signals, unable to carry out an information fusion function which is of importance to reach a reliable condition monitoring conclusion. Therefore, bivariate empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) is investigated in this paper to assess whether it could be a better solution for wind turbine condition monitoring. The effectiveness of the proposed technique in detecting machine incipient fault is compared with EMD and a recently developed wavelet-based 'energy tracking' technique. Experiments have shown that the proposed BEMD-based technique is more convenient than EMD for processing shaft vibration signals, and more powerful than EMD and wavelet-based techniques in terms of processing the non-stationary and nonlinear wind turbine condition monitoring signals and detecting incipient mechanical and electrical faults.

TI Sensor and actuator fault diagnosis for wind turbine systems by using

AB In this paper, we consider sensor and actuator fault detection and estimation issues for large scale wind turbine systems where individual pitch control (IPC) is used for load reduction. The faults considered are the blade root bending moment sensor faults and blade pitch actuator faults. In the first part, with the aid of a dynamical model of the wind turbine system, a so-called H-infinity/H- observer in the finite frequency range, is applied to generate the residual for fault detection. The observer is designed to be sensitive to faults but insensitive to disturbances, such as wind turbulence. When there is a detectable fault, the observer sends an alarm signal if the residual evaluation is larger than a predefined threshold. In addition to the fault detection, we also consider the fault estimation problem, where a dynamic filter is used to estimate the fault magnitude. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by simulation results for several fault scenarios. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID RELIABILITY; OPERATION
AB By utilizing condition monitoring information collected from wind turbine components, condition based maintenance (CBM) strategy can be used to reduce the operation and maintenance costs of wind power generation systems. The existing CBM methods for wind power generation systems deal with wind turbine components separately, that is, maintenance decisions are made on individual components, rather than the whole system. However, a wind farm generally consists of multiple wind turbines, and each wind turbine has multiple components including main bearing, gearbox, generator, etc. There are economic dependencies among wind turbines and their components. That is, once a maintenance team is sent to the wind farm, it may be more economical to take the opportunity to maintain multiple turbines, and when a turbine is stopped for maintenance, it may be more cost-effective to simultaneously replace multiple components which show relatively high risks. In this paper, we develop an optimal CBM solution to the above-mentioned issues. The proposed maintenance policy is defined by two failure probability threshold values at the wind turbine level. Based on the condition monitoring and prognostics information, the failure probability values at the component and the turbine levels can be calculated, and the optimal CBM decisions can be made accordingly. A simulation method is developed to evaluate the cost of the CBM policy. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed CBM approach. A comparative study based on commonly used constant-interval maintenance policy demonstrates the advantage of the proposed CBM approach in reducing the maintenance cost. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The condition monitoring measurements that can be obtained from wind turbine components include vibration data, acoustic emission data, oil analysis data, power voltage and current data, etc. The objective of condition based maintenance (CBM) is to optimize the maintenance activities based on the prognostics information to minimize the overall costs of wind power generation systems. In this paper, we develop a CBM approach for wind turbine systems considering the economic dependency of different wind turbine types. The proposed CBM policy is defined by failure probability threshold values at the wind turbine level. For each turbine type, two threshold values are defined. After failure probability values at the component level over the lead times, and at the turbine level, are calculated, decisions can be made on whether a maintenance team should be sent to the wind farm, which turbines should be maintained and which components should be maintained. Models are also developed to evaluate the cost for a certain CBM policy.

AB There is a constant need for the reduction of operational and maintenance costs of Wind Energy Conversion System(WECS). The most efficient way of reducing these costs would be to continuously monitor the condition of these systems, which allows for early detection of the degeneration of the generator health, facilitating a proactive response, minimizing downtime, and maximizing productivity. Wind generators are also inaccessible since they are situated on extremely high towers. There are also plans to increase the number of offshore sites increasing the need for a remote means of WECS monitoring that overcomes some of the difficulties of accessibility problems. Therefore it is important of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in WECS. The monitoring schemes of transfer its monitor status with JESS technology was put forward in this paper. A remote condition monitoring platform (RCMP) was designed and constructed in this project. And its result brings us an effective solution to deal with the WECS condition monitoring.

AB Condition monitoring system is pivotal for a wind farm to maximize the availability and economic efficiency of its wind turbines. This paper offers state-of-the-art condition monitoring systems to observe the current status of a wind turbine and to send out embryonic alarm signals before its fault. The developed system is mainly made up of four components: a data acquisition system, a signal processing system, a server PC with a user program and a variety of sensors. This system was installed in Yeung-Heung wind farm test bed, Korea last summer. This system is also expected to be applied into offshore wind turbines in the future.

AB As the share of wind energy increases on the global energy market, the efficient operation of wind farms gains an ever growing significance. Among operational decisions, the planning and scheduling of maintenance operations are crucial for the availability of turbines, as well as for the operational costs. The paper introduces a system that performs the detailed scheduling of maintenance operations at a set of wind farms maintained by common personnel. The scheduling problem is modeled and solved as a mixed-integer linear program. The system constitutes a module of an integrated framework for condition monitoring, diagnosis, and maintenance of wind turbines. (C) 2011 CIRP.

AB With increasingly complex and highly dynamical control strategies, an integration of condition monitoring and plant control becomes necessary. This integration makes it possible to achieve comprehensive recordings of raw sensor data together with control signals. As an excellent standard for exchange of such data, the HDF5 data format is proposed. Such recordings allow for more effective root cause failure analysis (RCFA), enabling the development and successive refinement of algorithms for automatic error detection and classification. As is shown, it becomes possible to use software modules with standardized interfaces, implementing state-of-the-art signal processing algorithms. As an example, the use of percentile values is discussed, which cope with fluctuations of non-stationary data and allow it to adapt sensitivity and robustness to a specific task. Finally, properties of known pattern classification techniques in respect to monitoring of power plants are analyzed.

AB This paper will study condition monitoring signals of a distributed generation (DG) system not only due to the mechanical and electrical faults inside the wind turbines but also due to the grid system fluctuations. A novel feature extraction and characterisation method based on singularity detection of the monitoring data will be presented, aiming to identify the abnormal events and fault conditions as early as possible. The algorithm used to calculate Lipschitz values is given in the paper and efficient processing and storage of monitoring data is also discussed. The preliminary research has produced promising results.

AB Condition Monitoring (CM) can greatly reduce the maintenance cost for a Wind Energy Converter (WEC). In this paper, history data of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is analyzed to detect the incipient failure of WEC generator bearing. A new condition monitoring method based on the Nonlinear State Estimate Technique (NSET) is proposed. NSET is used to construct the normal behavior model of the generator bearing temperature. When the generator bearing has an incipient failure, the residuals between NSET model estimates and the measured generator bearing temperature will become significant. When the residual exceeds the predefined thresholds, an incipient failure is flagged. Analysis of a manual drift added on the historical SCADA data for a WEC generator bearing demonstrates the effectiveness of this new condition monitoring method.

AB Bearing is the most frequently used component in a wind turbine, and its' faults would lead to completely stall of a machine. Therefore, bearing Fault Diagnosis is an important part of condition monitoring in a wind turbine. This paper presented a High Frequency Resonance (HFR) method to implement bearing fault detection and fault diagnosis. This technique extracted the amplitude and frequency modulations of the vibration signals which measured from a wind turbine system. For the amplitude demodulation is inherent in the vibration signals, the fault frequency will be detected from the spectrum of the transformed original signals. And the effectiveness of this approach has been validated by simulated signal and experimental data.

AB Wind energy is one of the fastest growing sources of renewable energy in Europe as well as on a global scale. In order to increase the competitiveness of wind power against other competing energy sources there is a profound need to optimise the operational and maintenance costs of wind turbines. The most efficient way of reducing these costs is through an evolution to predictive maintenance procedures based on condition monitoring of key turbine components. Condition monitoring allows early detection of degradation of the actual health of various components such as the gearbox, brake system, blade, tower, etc., facilitating a proactive response, minimising downtime, and maximising the overall annual capacity of wind farms. Due to the importance of condition monitoring for the wind energy industry and the need for future research, a substantial amount of research has been carried out in the field of wind turbine condition monitoring. This paper summarises this state of the art, describing different maintenance models, condition monitoring techniques and algorithms, and highlights the importance of the NIMO's system integrated concept. A qualitative evaluation using fault tree analysis has also been carried out to identify future research opportunities for fault diagnostics.

DE Acoustic Emission; Wind turbine blades; On-line monitoring
AB Wind turbine blades are among the most exposed parts of a wind turbine since, due to the nature of the wind, they are subject to aerodynamic loads with great variability, strong gusts of wind, and occasionally sustain severe weather conditions while rotating. Furthermore, the structural integrity of the composite material blades is critical to the entire wind turbine for safety reasons and also for increased efficiency. However, inspection of installed blades during operation, or even during off-line mode presents practical difficulties such as accessibility, nature of the material, size of the blades, complicated geometry, etc.
   Acoustic Emission (AE) has been proven highly effective in detecting and identifying damage in wind turbine blades and generally composites under load through numerous laboratory tests including full-scale blade tests. However, in-service monitoring experience of wind turbine blades is limited. Within the scopes of a European-funded research project (NIMO), which aims to develop a novel, integrated condition monitoring system for wind turbines, a module was developed and installed on a wind turbine for structural health monitoring of the rotor blades during operation.
   In the present paper, a brief description of the developed module is provided, as well as the difficulties that had to be overcome during the installation of the system. AE data acquired during the first trials of the system is presented, along with advanced data analysis through pattern recognition and neural networks software.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB The operating conditions of wind turbine components have been monitored by fitting acoustic emission (AE) and vibration sensors inside wind turbines and analysing sensor measurements using appropriate signal processing techniques. However, there is still no systematic approach which can take the operating parameters of wind turbines into account when analysing the sensor measurements for condition monitoring purposes. The operating parameters of wind turbines such as, for example, wind speed, wind direction and turbine power output, etc. often have a significant effect on the measured AE and vibration signals. Therefore there is a need to develop an effective technique which can systematically consider the effect of these wind turbine operating parameters on the features of measured AE and/or vibration signals. Consequently, any change in the signal features which are literally produced by abnormality of turbine components and/or system can be correctly identified.
   Motivated by this objective, in the present study, we propose a novel baseline model based technique for condition monitoring of wind turbine components. The idea is to establish a baseline model for an operating wind turbine which represents the relationship between the wind speed, turbine power output, etc. turbine operating parameters and the appropriate features of correspondingly measured vibration and/or AE signals. Given a specific working condition, the model output can be regarded as the baseline features of measured AE and/or vibration signals. Therefore, any significant deviation of practically measured AE and vibration signal features from the baseline can be explained to be due to some kind of abnormality inside turbine components and/or system. Consequently, the information can be effectively used to achieve the objective of condition monitoring, even fault diagnosis.
   The application of the proposed method to the real AE, vibration and turbine operating parameter (wind speed and power output) data collected from an operating wind turbine is described in the paper. The results verify the effectiveness of the new approach and demonstrate its potential to address complicated offshore wind turbine condition monitoring problems.

AB This paper presents the role of SeeBytes RECOVERY system within the wind energy industry, with specific focus on an offshore scenario. The current generation of condition monitoring systems (CMS) in relation to wind energy are generally provided by turbine manufacturers, or have been adapted from other industries. These systems have a propensity to focus explicitly on individual parts of the turbine (e.g. gearbox and bearings), therefore they are limited in monitoring scope and do not benefit from a system-wide view allowing an understanding of cause and effect across all parts of the turbine. This poor overview of the turbine system means that systems available today are seen as being prone to false alarms which lead to incorrect diagnosis (e.g. incorrect recognition of a sensor failure or of the cause of a vibration) and unnecessary intervention, the cry wolf syndrome, where ultimately important warnings are ignored. In addition, this approach could lead to costly incorrect diagnoses.
   To fully realise the potential of condition monitoring and its impact on decision making/maintenance scheduling, RECOVERY, as a holistic condition monitoring system, is able to monitor the entire wind turbine in an integrated manner. This proposed holistic system takes a broad view of events and sensor values across the complete turbine system and subsystems (also across a complete farm) to improve diagnostic correctness and reduce no-fault-found situations. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the capability of RECOVERY to fuse data from multiple sources, increasing the ability to predict failures event, and reducing the number of false alarms.

AB Condition Monitoring of bearings used in machines working under non-stationary load is an important issue. The varying load affects a vibration signal acquired from bearings and makes the diagnosis difficult. These difficulties come from the variation of diagnostic features caused mostly by load variation. In the paper a novel diagnostic approach is proposed for main rotor bearings used in wind turbines. From a commercial diagnostic system two kind of information have been acquired: peak-to-peak vibration acceleration and generator power that is related to the operating conditions. The received data cover the period of several months, when the bearing has been replaced due to its failure and the new one has been installed. Due to serious variation of the mentioned data, a decision making regarding the condition of bearings is very difficult. Application of a classical statistical pattern recognition for data from the period A (bad condition) and the period B (after replacement, good condition) is not sufficient due to probability density functions of features overlapping (pdf of peak-to-peak feature for bad and good conditions). Proposed approach based on an idea proposed earlier for planetary gearboxes, i.e. to analyse data for bad/good conditions in two dimensional space, feature - load is presented. Using the proposed procedure, it has been decided to reject some data for smallest and highest load conditions. It is shown that the final data presentation is a good basis to the very successful classification of data (i.e. recognition of damaged and undamaged bearings).

AB Metallic wear debris sensors using inductive sensing technologies are available commercially from several manufacturers and are ideally suited to online condition monitoring of the lubricating oil in wind turbine gearsets. Wind turbines are frequently located in remote areas with difficult and restricted access. The ability to monitor wear in real time and from a distance is of great importance in assessing the health and mitigating failure in the gearsets.

AB This work illustrates the updating and incorporation of information in the assessment of fatigue reliability for offshore wind turbine. The new information, coming from external and condition monitoring can be used to direct updating of the stochastic variables through a non-parametric Bayesian updating approach and be integrated in the reliability analysis by a third-order polynomial chaos expansion approximation. Although Classical Bayesian updating approaches are often used because of its parametric formulation, non-parametric approaches are better alternatives for multi-parametric updating with a non-conjugating formulation. The results in this paper show the influence on the time dependent updated reliability when non-parametric and classical Bayesian approaches are used. Further, the influence on the reliability of the number of updated parameters is illustrated.

AB The logistics and expense of obtaining oil samples from wind farms are among the conditions that make it challenging to establish a valuable condition monitoring program. Optimizing the oil condition monitoring program for a wind turbine is a critical step towards achieving forecasted ROI for the wind farm. To advance the current oil condition monitoring practices for most wind turbines, 150 identical wind turbine systems in the field for up to four years were studied. Several oil analysis tests were performed to understand the depletion of additives and changes in fluid chemistry. Basic statistical analysis was obtained on the data set to identify correlations in the data. The result of the analysis was a better understanding of the wind turbine oil's formulation and the relationship to fluid degradation and gearbox condition. The statistical methodology that we performed can be applied to other wind turbine farms to improve the knowledge derived from their oil analysis tests, both for gear as well hydraulic oils. In addition, other innovative tests were suggested which may augment a current oil analysis test slate to improve the value of their program.

ID VISCOSITY
AB Oil condition monitoring is a vital part of integrated asset health management. With an increasing impetus toward real-time decision making, delays incurred in offline laboratory oil analysis are becoming less acceptable. At present, several oil quality parameters can be monitored by commercially available sensors, and active research and development programmes are being pursued by both academic and industrial researchers to-develop robust, cost effective sensors for the remaining key parameters. Published (active) ASTM methods or practices do not yet cover the sensor technologies employed or under development, although work is in progress to address this deficit. This paper presents an overview of currently available oil condition sensors and looks at some recent developments, particularly in the following three areas: contamination by metallic wear debris, measurement of total water content, and determination of in-service oil viscosity. In each case, quite different technological solutions have been adopted. Where applicable, alignment and overlap with existing ASTM methods and practices will be reviewed and future directions indicated. Recent improvements in the sensitivity of inductive particle counters have enabled the detection of individual ferrous particles down to the sub-100 mu m diameter regime and close to the 100 mu m diameter mark for non-ferrous metals. Experiences of particle counters in wind turbine applications have shown the potential for enormous benefits in failure prevention. One standard practice covering the installation, operation, and requirements of such devices is published and a second is currently in draft mode. Online sensors utilising infrared transmission measurements recently have been developed by two independent companies. The systems are targeted primarily at marine diesel engine installations, although the method is not restricted solely to these applications. Maximum water content measurable depends on both the optical path length and the cleanliness of the oil. For marine applications a practical upper measurement limit of 1 % by volume has been adopted. In the system described here, a correction methodology, correlating to an accepted Deutsches Institut fur Normung-Fourier transform infrared standard, has been adopted to cope with oils contaminated by soot. Soot loading increases the opacity of the oil, causing a concomitant reduction in the maximum water content measurable. The correction procedure increases the accuracy of the water content measurement and additionally provides a determination of the soot content. Commercially available viscosity sensors include both the oscillating piston type and high frequency oscillating crystal designs; however, a cost effective device employing a low amplitude, mid -frequency vibrating sensor element has been developed recently. Key features include accurate measurements over a very wide viscosity range and an operating range that covers combustion engine oil temperatures and pressures. Correlation with existing ASTM methods and practices is presently limited to calibration aspects only.

AB There is a constant need for the reduction of operational and maintenance costs of Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS). The most efficient way of reducing these costs would be to continuously monitor the condition of these systems, which allows for early detection of the degeneration of the generator health, facilitating a proactive response, minimizing downtime, and maximizing productivity. Wind generators are also inaccessible since they are situated on extremely high towers, which are usually 70m more in height. There are also plans to increase the number of offshore sites increasing the need for a remote means of WECS monitoring that overcomes some of the difficulties of accessibility problems. Therefore it is important of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in WECS. A monitoring scheme of transfer its monitor status with AJAX technology was put forwords in this paper. A remote condition monitoring platform (RCMP) was designed and constructed in this project. And its result brings us an effective solution to deal with the WECS condition monitoring.

AB Condition monitoring of machines working under non-stationary operations is one of the most challenging problems in maintenance. A wind turbine is an example of such class of machines. One of effective approaches may be to identify operating conditions and investigate their influence on used diagnostic features. Commonly used methods based on measurement of electric current, rotational speed, power and other process variables require additional equipment (sensors, acquisition cards) and software. It is proposed to use advanced signal processing techniques for instantaneous shaft speed recovery from a vibration signal. It may be used instead of extra channels or in parallel as signal verification.

AB This paper presents the research activity performed on a Small Wind Turbine (SWT) test stand. Commercially available turbine was modified towards incorporation of the sensors system for condition monitoring. Installed sensors measure angular shaft position, torque applied from the wind loads, vibration accelerations and last but not least rotational speed. All gathered data are then transferred and processed in Test. Lab by means of automatic in house developed Visual Basic application which afterwards converts TDF files to text files and stores them in a desired directory. The obtained signals can then be used as input parameters for AMESim simulation of the same Small Wind Turbine. The numerical simulation is being run in parallel to installed sensors measurements and is as well controlled by the same Visual Basic application. By having actual measurements and numerical simulation results one will be able to compare those two outcomes. In particular, if the numerical model is tailored to the physical one, data comparison will allow identifying malfunctioning due to component damage or extreme working condition.

AB Vibration analysis has found widespread application for condition monitoring in a variety of applications and industries. With the continual development of cheaper and more powerful processing hardware, such systems have developed from utilizing simple checks on amplitude to those based around sophisticated spectral analysis. Most current systems that are employed for rotating machines operate by examining the gain and phase of the spectral components at both the fundamental frequency of rotation and a number of higher order harmonics. These components are then compared with normal signatures and any deviation is used to declare possibility of a fault. Differences in specific spectral lines, for example harmonics associated with blade passing or gear meshing frequencies, can be used to diagnose particular faults. Such analysis, however, has proven to be difficult to automate and relies on the off-line interpretation of a trained vibration expert. The paper presents application of the model based diagnostics method for early detection of faults in rotating machinery. The proposed diagnostic system based on two methods - modal analysis (OMA and OMAX methods) and non-linear signals models (NARX). The paper presents the application of the powerful class of non-linear signal processing tools known as NARX in rotating machinery diagnostic. The paper also presents an application of OMAX method in rotating machinery diagnostic. The OMAX method is formulated with an assumption that both measurable and immeasurable forces excite shaft vibrations. The proposed system was verified during research on a specialized test rig, which can generate vibration signals and on data recorded at wind turbine.

AB To operate wind turbines safely and efficiently, condition monitoring for the main components are of increasing importance. Especially, the lack of access of offshore installations increases inspection and maintenance costs. The installation of a condition monitoring system will cause a decisive impact on reliability and maintenance and considerably reduce down times by condition dependent inspections. So far, such systems are installed only in a low percentage of the wind turbines. Furthermore, there is a limitation on monitoring of changes in Eigen frequencies. Usually, this type of information does not provide a spatial resolution necessary for damage detection and localization of structural changes. The current work at Fraunhofer IZFP Dresden in the field of monitoring of wind turbines is focused on the development of a condition monitoring systems for rotor blades. The monitoring concept is based on a combination of low frequency integral vibration monitoring and acoustic monitoring techniques in the frequency range between 10 kHz and 100 kHz using guided waves. The paper is focused on the results of the acoustic emission measurements that were used in a full-scale fatigue test at a rotor blade made from carbon-and glass fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP, GFRP) with an overall length of 40 meters. The spatial and temporal development of the acoustic emissions and their signal parameters can be used as damage indicator. Moreover, the test instrumentation and results of acoustic emission measurements on a rotating rotor blade are shown. When using acoustic emission on such a field installation one has to overcome additional parameters caused by environmental influences like rain and wind speed to name a few of them. It can be shown, that the acoustic emission hit rate correlates with wind speed.

AB Wind turbine blades have to withstand a high number of load cycles in mostly hard weather conditions over 20 years. In a research project BAM and several partners have designed, evaluated and tested a condition monitoring system for all parts of a wind turbine. At a rotorblade with a length of 58 m fibre bragg grating sensors were applied for in-service strain measurement. Additionally a complex test rig was designed to enable real biaxial loading conditions at a representative test rotor blade to simulate the mechanical loading conditions in the lab. In this test blade with a length of 8 m also fibre bragg grating sensors were implemented to determine their influences for the structure and the condition monitoring system. Vibration measurements were carried out at different test phases. The results were compared with finite element strain and modal analysis.

AB In recent years, rapid growth in wind energy as a substantial source of electricity generation has created greater demands on wind turbine system reliability and availability. To reduce service costs and maximize return on investment, wind farm operators have begun to take a more proactive approach to turbine problems by relying on intelligent condition monitoring and automated failure detection systems. The challenge is how to effectively convert large amounts of data into actionable decisions to detect and isolate failures at an early stage. This paper describes a unique data analysis and modeling technique for online turbine health monitoring and automatic root cause assessment. It provides a means to capture failure signatures for specific root causes based on historical events as well as engineering knowledge. Both continuous and discrete turbine condition monitoring data are processed to provide a failure probability assessment. First, statistical trend analysis, feature extraction and classification methods are developed to analyze a continuous sensor data set. Secondly, a pattern recognition method is applied to calculate failure indicators from various discrete control system events, or fault messages. Then failure likelihoods derived from both the continuous and the discrete models are combined in a fusion model to increase predictive accuracy. A demonstration of the method on bearing failure modeling using SCADA data will be provided with promising results.

AB The main driver behind developing advanced condition monitoring (CM) systems for the wind energy industry is the delivery of improved asset management regarding the operation and maintenance of the gearbox and other wind turbine components and systems. Current gearbox CM systems mainly detect faults by identifying ferrous materials, water and air within oil by changes in certain properties such as electrical fields. In order to detect oil degradation and identify particles, more advanced devices are required so allow a better maintenance regime to be established. Current technologies available specifically for this purpose include Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and ferrography. There are also several technologies that have not yet been or have been recently applied to CM problems. After reviewing the current state of the art, it is recommended that a combination of sensors would be used that analyse different characteristics of the oil. The information individually would not be highly accurate but combined, it is fully expected that greater accuracy can be obtained. The technologies that are suitable in terms of cost, size, accuracy and development are online ferrography, selective fluorescence spectroscopy, scattering measurements, FTIR, photoacoustic spectroscopy and solid state viscometers.

AB The rapid expansion of wind farms has drawn attention to operations and maintenance issues. Condition monitoring solutions have been developed to detect and diagnose abnormalities of various wind turbine subsystems with the goal of reducing operations and maintenance costs. This paper explores fault data provided by the supervisory control and data acquisition system and offers fault prediction at three levels: (1) fault and no-fault prediction; (2) fault category (severity): and (3) the specific fault prediction. For each level, the emerging faults are predicted 5-60 min before they occur. Various data-mining algorithms have been applied to develop models predicting possible faults. Computational results validating the models are provided. The research limitations are discussed. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID TERMS
AB Based on the Morlet wavelet transformation and Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), we present a wind turbine fault diagnosis method in this paper. Wind turbine can be damaged by moisture absorption, fatigue, wind gusts or lightening strikes. Due to this reason, there is an increasing need to monitor the health of these structures. Vibration analysis is the best-known technology applied in wind turbine condition monitoring, in which the time-frequency analysis techniques such as Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) are widely used. Theoretically WVD has an infinite resolution in time-frequency domain. For early wind turbine fault signals, however, there are two main difficulties in WVD analysis. One is strong noise signals in the background and the other is cross terms in WVD itself. In this paper, continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) is employed to filter useless noise in raw vibration signals, and auto terms window (ATW) function is used to suppress the cross terms in WVD. In the CWT de-noising process, the Morlet wavelet, whose shape is similar to mechanical shock signals, is chosen to perform CWT on the raw vibration signals. The appropriate scale parameter for CWT is optimized by the cross validation method (CVM). An ATW based on the Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (SPWVD) spectrum is taken to be a window function to suppress the cross terms in WVD. The new method can not only remove cross terms faraway from the auto terms, but also keep high energy close to every instantaneous frequency, the virtues such as high time-frequency resolution, and good energy aggregation etc. The wind turbine gear fault diagnosis experiment results indicate that the proposed method has a good de-nosing performance and is effective in suppressing the cross terms and extracting fault feature.

AB With an increasing number of wind turbines being erected offshore, there is a need for cost-effective, predictive, and proactive maintenance. A large fraction of wind turbine downtime is due to bearing failures, particularly in the generator and gearbox. One way of assessing impending problems is to install vibration sensors in key positions on these subassemblies. Such equipment can be costly and requires sophisticated software for analysis of the data. An alternative approach, which does not require extra sensors, is investigated in this paper. This involves monitoring the power output of a variable-speed wind turbine generator and processing the data using a wavelet in order to extract the strength of particular frequency components, characteristic of faults. This has been done for doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs), commonly used in modern variable-speed wind turbines. The technique is first validated on a test rig under controlled fault conditions and then is applied to two operational wind turbine DFIGs where generator shaft misalignment was detected. For one of these turbines, the technique detected a problem 3 months before a bearing failure was recorded.

AB A sound maintenance planning is of crucial importance for wind power systems. There is a large potential in cost savings by optimizing maintenance decisions to make the projects more cost-efficient. This paper presents an approach to optimize condition-based maintenance strategies for components which degradation can be classified according to the severity of the damage. The approach is applicable to inspection-based maintenance as well as maintenance based on online condition-monitoring systems. This enables us to compare the maintenance strategies within a unified framework. First decisions associated with the different maintenance strategies are optimized, then the expected life cycle maintenance costs of the strategies are compared. The model is applied to blades of wind turbine in order to compare three maintenance strategies: visual inspection, inspection with a condition-monitoring technique (e.g., ultrasonic or thermography), and online condition monitoring (e.g., fiber optic). It is shown that online condition monitoring is the optimal maintenance strategy for high failure rate and low crack time to failure. In other cases, inspection with condition-based maintenance is slightly more beneficial.

AB Wind turbine condition monitoring systems provide an early indication of component damage, allowing the operator to plan system repair prior to complete failure. However, the resulting cost savings are limited because of the relatively low number of failures that may be detected and the high cost of installing the required measurement equipment. A new approach is proposed for continuous, online calculation of damage accumulation using standard turbine performance parameters and Physics of Failure methodology. The wind turbine system is assessed in order to identify the root cause of critical failure modes and theoretical damage models are developed to describe the relationship between the turbine operating environment, applied loads and the rate at which damage accumulates. Accurate estimates may then be made in real time concerning the probability of failure for specific failure modes and components. The methodology is illustrated for a specific failure mode using a case study of a large wind farm where a significant number of gearbox failures occurred within a short space of time. Such an approach may be implemented at relatively low cost and offers potential for significant improvements in overall wind turbine maintenance strategy. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Wind energy is one of renewable energy sources, which is copiously available without any limitation. Wind turbines are used to tap the potential of wind energy. Thus, stability and reliability of wind turbine is critical to extract this maximum amount of energy from the wind. To keep the wind turbine in operation, implementation of condition monitoring is paramount. This paper, firstly, demonstrates the principle, the interrogation system and the selection of operational style of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. Secondly, condition monitoring in wind turbines by using embedded FBG sensors is described in details. Finally, questions and future are carried out. FBG sensor system can keep away the wind turbines from catastrophic conditions due to sudden breakdowns.

AB Previous condition monitoring products classify the wind turbine operation condition based on one operation parameter. And a series of monitoring alarm thresholds are defined for each one of the classified wind turbine operation conditions. This leads to a lot of false alarms during the application of condition monitoring system of wind turbine. This paper uses multiple operation parameters to classify the complex and non-stationary wind turbine operation conditions related to vibration. In this paper, after preprocessing the actual operation data of a wind turbine, the false alarm rate is defined as a rationality evaluation index of operation condition classification methods. Afterwards, this paper proposes respectively two multiple parameters classification methods based on rough sets and support vector machine to classify the normal operation condition of wind turbine and calculates the false alarm rate based on testing different operation condition classification methods. The test results show that the two intelligent methods can decrease the false alarm rate obviously. Finally, the test results of different operation condition classification methods are compared and analyzed.

AB Cost-effective wind turbine (WT) condition monitoring assumes more importance as turbine sizes increase and they are placed in more remote locations, for example, offshore. Conventional condition monitoring techniques, such as vibration, lubrication oil, and generator current signal analysis, require the deployment of a variety of sensors and computationally intensive analysis techniques. This paper describes a WT condition monitoring technique that uses the generator output power and rotational speed to derive a fault detection signal. The detection algorithm uses a continuous-wavelet-transform-based adaptive filter to track the energy in the prescribed time-varying fault-related frequency bands in the power signal. The central frequency of the filter is controlled by the generator speed, and the filter bandwidth is adapted to the speed fluctuation. Using this technique, fault features can be extracted, with low calculation times, from director indirect-drive fixed-or variable-speed WTs. The proposed technique has been validated experimentally on a WT drive train test rig. A synchronous or induction generator was successively installed on the test rig, and both mechanical and electrical fault-like perturbations were successfully detected when applied to the test rig.

AB The condition monitoring system is essential for a large-scale wind turbine system to maximize its availability and reliability. In order to develop its effective condition monitoring algorithms, a wind turbine simulator is necessary for such a large-scale system. However, the existing simulators consisting of a motor and a generator are not suitable for this purpose, because they have not the general configuration of wind turbine systems. To solve this problem, we are now developing a novel wind turbine simulator that is composed of blades, a step-up gearbox and a generator. This paper presents a developed condition monitoring system and the design procedure of the wind turbine simulator.

AB This paper presents the role of SeeByte's RECOVERY system within the wind energy industry, with specific focus on an offshore scenario. The current generation of condition monitoring systems (CMS) in relation to wind energy are generally provided by turbine manufacturers, or have been adapted from other industries. These systems have a propensity to focus explicitly on individual parts of the turbine (e. g. gearbox and bearings), therefore they are limited in monitoring scope and do not benefit from a system-wide view allowing an understanding of cause and effect across all parts of the turbine. This poor overview of the turbine system means that systems available today are seen as being prone to false alarms which lead to incorrect diagnosis (e. g. incorrect recognition of a sensor failure or of the cause of a vibration) and unnecessary intervention, the 'cry wolf' syndrome, where ultimately important warnings are ignored. In addition, this approach could lead to costly incorrect diagnoses.
   To fully realise the potential of condition monitoring and its impact on decision making/maintenance scheduling, RECOVERY, as a holistic condition monitoring system, is able to monitor the entire wind turbine in an integrated manner. This proposed holistic system takes a broad view of events and sensor values across the complete turbine system and subsystems (also across a complete farm) to improve diagnostic correctness and reduce no-fault-found situations.

DE Bragg grating; wind turbine blade; monitoring system
AB As an clean renewable energy source wind energy is highly regarded by various countries in the world. Wind turbine blade is one of the most important components in wind turbine. It is the key component for receiving wind energy. As turbine size steps up and the size of modern turbine blade increases, condition monitoring and maintenance of blades become more important. Strain detection is one of the most effective methods to monitor blade condition. Sensitivity for EMC and lightning and zero drift of conventional strain gauges bring a lot of trouble. In this paper, a fibre Bragg grating sensor system is used for blade monitoring. The system overcomes the shortcomings. It is dainty, reliable, convenient to multiplex and so on.

AB The use of open-source software in many institutions and organizations is increasing. However, a balance should be considered between the software cost and the cost of its technical support and reliability. In this article, a maintenance system for wind farms will be presented. It is connected to an information system for maintenance, called SNIFF (Terology Integrated Modular System) as a general base to manage the assets and as a support strategic line to the evolution of this system, which incorporates on-condition maintenance modules, and the support to the research and development done around this theme. The SMIT system is based on a TCP/IP network, using a Linux server running a PostgreSQL database and Apache web server with PHP, and Octave and R software for numerical analysis. Maintenance technicians, chiefs, economic and production management personnel can access SMIT database through SMIT clients for Windows. In addition, this maintenance system for wind systems uses also special low cost hardware for data acquisition on floor level. The hardware uses a distributed TCP/IP network to synchronize SMIT server master clock through Precision Time Protocol. Usually, the manufactures construct, deploy and give the means for the suppliers to perform the wind system's maintenance. This is a very competitive area, where companies tend to hide the development details and implementations. Within this scenario, the development of maintenance management models for multiple wind equipments is important, and will allow countries to be more competitive in a growing market. For on-condition monitoring, the algorithms are based on Support Vector Machines and time series analysis running under Octave and R open-source software's.

AB Knowledge about the condition and the remaining lifetime of the structural components of WEPs provides considerable advantages for the manufacturers, owners and insurers. To gain this knowledge, two monitoring systems have been developed, one for the structural condition monitoring and one for the lifetime condition monitoring. Both systems need only little additional measuring expense or none at all, the main part is in the software evaluating the measurement results and parts of the wind and control data. The results of the verification at multi-megawatt wind turbines show that the systems work satisfactorily and that even a sensor-free lifetime monitoring is possible.

AB This paper presents the research activity performed on the Small Wind System test stand. Commercially available turbine was modified towards incorporation of the sensors system for condition monitoring. Installed sensors measure angular shaft position, torque applied from the wind loads and vibration accelerations and last but not least rotational speed. All gathered data is then transferred and processed in Test. Lab all by means of automatic in house developed visual basic application which afterwards converts TDF files to text files and stores them in desired directory. Obtained signals are used as input parameters for AMESim simulation of the same Small Wind System. The numerical simulation is being run in parallel to installed sensors measurements and is as well controlled by the same visual basic application. Having real measurements and numerical simulation results one will be able to compare those two outcomes.(1)

AB To operate wind turbines safely and efficiently, condition monitoring for the main components are of increasing importance. Especially, the lack of access of offshore installations increases inspection and maintenance costs. The installation of a condition monitoring system will cause a decisive impact on reliability and maintenance and considerably reduce shut off times by condition dependent inspections. So far, such systems are installed only in a low percentage of the wind turbines. Furthermore, there is a limitation on monitoring of changes in eigenfrequencies. Usually, this type of information does not provide a spatial resolution necessary for damage detection and localisation of structural changes. The current work at Fraunhofer IZFP Dresden in the field of monitoring of wind turbines is focused on the development of a condition monitoring systems for rotor blades. The monitoring concept is based on a combination of low frequency integral vibration monitoring and acoustic monitoring techniques in the frequency range between 10 kHz and 100 kHz using guided waves. A joint application of acousto ultrasonics and acoustic emission techniques are used. The following paper explains the acoustic emission measurements in detail. Results of acoustic emission monitoring are shown based on measurements of a currently running dynamic fatigue test at a 40 m rotor blade.
